B. Oh, yes. I get six Korean channels but nothing in English!

A. People are funny.
B. They sure are.
A. Did you hear about the pilot?
B. The one that stole a small plane?
A. Yes, he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U.S.
B. Did they catch him?
A. Yes. After two U.S. fighter jets followed him for an hour, he landed on a highway.
B. Did he crash?
A. No, he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant.
B. Did the cops find out why he flew into the U.S.?
A. His life sucked. He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down.
B. Poor guy.

A. The police need our help finding a robber.
B. How do you know?
A. The TV news is reporting a bank robbery.
B. Do they know what the robber looks like?
A. Yes, he's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old.
B. What race is he?
A. They didn't say.
B. The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore.
A. Of course not. That would be racist.
B. But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?
A. Don't ask me.
B. Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist.

A. Don't wipe your nose on your sleeve.
B. But I don't have a tissue.
A. Then go find a tissue in the bathroom.
B. I didn't have time to get one from there.
A. Your sleeves are not tissues.
B. But Mom, all my friends use their sleeves.
A. That doesn't make it right.
B. I saw Dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.
A. I will talk to your father about that.
B. I bet Dad did it all the time when he was my age.
A. Your daddy was a good little boy.
B. How do you know? Were you his mommy, too?

A. I'm worried.
B. Worried about what?
A. I'm getting married.
B. You should be happy, not worried.
A. I am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility.
B. Yes, you have to take care of your wife.
A. And I have to take care of our children.
B. Are you going to start a family?
A. Yes. We want to have a little boy and a little girl.
B. That sounds wonderful.
A. Except we can't afford it!
B. No wonder you're worried.

A. I don't get art.
B. Or artists.
A. They're in a different world.
B. I saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.
A. The artist said the jar was both full and empty.
B. But it was full of pencils! How could he say it was empty?
A. Artists see things differently.
B. Did you ever see anything that Picasso painted?
A. Of course! He's world famous.
B. Did he ever take art lessons?
A. I can't believe it. I drew paintings like that in third grade.
B. Where are they? Maybe they are worth millions.

A. What's the point?
B. The point of what?
A. Of living.
B. Who knows? You live, and then you die.
A. We must be here for some reason.
B. Maybe we're here to have fun.
A. Then why aren't I having fun?
B. Because you're thinking too much.
A. So I should stop thinking?
B. Stop thinking about what the point is.
A. Okay. I'll start thinking about having some fun.
B. Just be patient. Fun doesn't come along every five minutes.

A. Beer is a powerful drug.
B. So are cigarettes.
A. Which would you prefer?
B. What do you mean?
A. When you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes.
B. I could pick only one or the other?
A. Yes. Nothing's perfect, not even in heaven.
B. Boy, that's a tough one.
A. What's so tough about it? Of course, I would pick cigarettes.
B. But cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.
A. Well, you can't have everything.
B. I don't think I want to go to your heaven.

A. My pants have a hole in the front pocket.
B. You shouldn't carry pens in your pocket.
A. Yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe.
B. Lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.
A. Who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?
B. Criminals, of course.
A. Anyway, I have to fix the hole.
B. You can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.
A. Tell me about this patch.
B. The patch has glue. The hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.
A. That sounds a lot easier than sewing.
B. It is. But after about ten washings, the glue washes off.

A. Do you know any good jokes?
B. I can't remember jokes.
A. Neither can I.
B. They go in one ear and out the other.
A. Who makes up all these jokes?
B. Who knows? But there must be a hundred new ones every day.
A. Yes, just in English alone.
B. I wonder if every language has jokes.
A. Of course! People everywhere like good jokes.
B. What do you think people joke about the most?
A. I think most jokes are about women.
B. Oh, really? I think most jokes are about men!

A. You're very lucky.
B. Why do you say that?
A. You speak two languages.
B. Well, my English isn't perfect.
A. No one speaks perfect English.
B. Maybe I will be the first!
A. I've been thinking about learning Spanish.
B. Spanish is easy. I'll be happy to teach you.
A. How long will it take me to learn?
B. I think it will only take you a year or two.
A. How soon can we begin?
B. Ahora! That means right now.

A. Do you know what today is?
B. Yes, it's April 22.
A. It's more than just a date.
B. Is it your birthday or anniversary?
A. No, it's Earth Day.
B. What's that?
A. It's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.
B. Oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?
A. Yes. We need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags.
B. How about if I take shorter showers?
A. That's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water.
B. From now on I'll spend only 20 minutes in the shower.

A. Poetry sucks.
B. I don't know anyone who likes it.
A. Some of it is okay, I guess.
B. Yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember.
A. Like "One, two, buckle my shoe."
B. But people still write poems.
A. No one makes any money at it.
B. Shakespeare was a poet.
A. Did he get rich from his poetry?
B. Probably not.
A. Poems are a little bit like songs.
B. Yes, but songs have music. Without music, songs would suck, too.

A. How smart are you?
B. I don't know. I think I'm average.
A. Did you ever take an IQ test?
B. No, I never did. All I know is that I got A's and B's in school.
A. I wish I was really smart.
B. Don't be ridiculous.
A. What do you mean?
B. If you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous.
A. Don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart?
B. It must be very lonely.
A. Why's that?
B. Because if you're super-smart, no one understands what you're saying.

A. I missed the TV news last night. What was on?
B. Nothing that would pass as news.
A. What's the weather going to be like this weekend?
B. I don't know. Whenever the weather comes on, I switch channels.

B. Some actress was in court for driving without a license.
A. What was the second story?
B. Some actor married a woman young enough to be his daughter.
A. What was the third story?
B. A bull chased a man in a supermarket.
A. Wasn't there anything about Octo-Mom?
B. Of course. She's going to hire a nanny for her eight infants.

A. What are you going to do about your death?
B. Well, mostly I'll try to avoid it.
A. I mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?
B. My wife and I will be cremated.
A. Are you going to be buried next to each other?
B. Oh, no. Our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.
A. You're not going to be buried?
B. A coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.
A. Yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you.
B. Children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.
A. That's true. A cemetery is for dead people, not living people.
B. We figure our kids can visit us whenever they go to the beach.

A. Did you wipe your feet? 
B. Yes, of course I wiped my feet.
A. Then why is there mud on the carpet?
B. I don't know. It's not my mud.
A. Well, someone brought it into the house.
B. Look at the bottom of my shoes—they're clean.
A. Of course they're clean. You left all the mud on the carpet.
B. Okay, I'll get the vacuum cleaner.
A. Don't vacuum it now.
B. Don't you want me to clean up the mud?
A. Wait till it dries. It will be easier to vacuum.
B. Next time I will be more careful.

A. What are you getting for your mom?
B. What are you talking about?
A. Sunday is Mother's Day.
B. This Sunday?
A. Of course. It's all over the news.
B. I thought it was next Sunday.
A. Well, you'd better get her something.
B. I'll get her a nice card.
A. Is that it?
B. Yes. That's all I ever give her.
A. She raised you, and all you ever give her is a card?
B. It's okay. She knows that I love her.

A. I don't like our flag.
B. What's the matter with it?
A. It's too much like other flags.
B. Yes, a lot of flags have stripes.
A. A flag should be pretty.
B. What should our flag look like?
A. It should have a pretty woman on it.
B. That's ridiculous!
A. You don't like pretty women?
B. Of course I do. But not on our flag!
A. Every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.
B. You can't go to war carrying a flag with a woman on it!

A. I had a busy morning.
B. What did you do?
A. I watered all the plants.
B. You have a lot of plants.
A. Then I did my laundry.
B. That takes some time.
A. I took the dog for a walk.
B. I'll bet he enjoyed his walk.
A. I vacuumed the entire house.
B. That's a lot of work.
A. And then I made lunch.
B. I'll bet you were hungry!

A. I don't have long distance service with my home phone.
B. So how do you make long distance calls?
A. I use a calling card.
B. Where do you get that?
A. I buy it at the dollar store.
B. How much is it?
A. It's one dollar for 100 minutes.
B. That's only a penny a minute!
A. It's a great price. But you have to dial a lot of numbers.
B. How many?
A. First you dial seven numbers, then ten numbers, then ten more numbers.
B. Yikes. I think I'll keep my long distance service.

A. Do you go to college?
B. Yes, I do.
A. What college do you go to?
B. I go to Pasadena City College.
A. Do you like it?
B. Oh, yes, I really like it.
A. Why do you like it?
B. Because it has great teachers.
A. What else?
B. I like all my classmates, too.
A. Anything else?
B. Yes. It's not expensive!

A. I lost my new pen.
B. Where did you lose it?
A. I don't know.
B. When did you lose it?
A. I think I lost it today. I used it yesterday.
B. Did you check all your pockets?
A. I checked all my pockets.
B. Did you look in your desk?
A. Yes. It isn't there, either.
B. It's probably around somewhere.
A. Oh, well, it only cost me a dollar.
B. Only a dollar? Don't even look for it.

A. Gravity is very important.
B. What is gravity?
A. It's the force that pulls everything down.
B. I don't understand.
A. If you pour water into a glass, the water goes down into the glass.
B. Of course it does.
A. Without gravity, the water would go up.
B. You're joking.
A. Without gravity, you would go up.
B. What do you mean?
A. You would float into the sky like a balloon.
B. That would be fun!

A. I can't read my book.
B. Turn on the light.
A. The light is on.

A. The book is open.
B. See an eye doctor.
A. That's what I need to do.
B. He'll give you a prescription for glasses.
A. I'll make an appointment tomorrow.
B. I'll get the yellow pages for an eye doctor.
A. Read the phone number to me.
B. I'll read it very loud, in case your hearing is getting bad, too.

A. What do you need for school?
B. I need pencils.
A. Anything else?
B. I need a notebook.
A. Do you need a pen?
B. No. I already have a pen.
A. Do you need a calculator?
B. No. The teacher doesn't permit calculators.
A. How about a dictionary?
B. No, we have a big dictionary in the classroom.
A. Well, I guess that's it.
B. Yes, that's all I need for now.

A. I like this magazine.
B. So do I.
A. I read it once, and I subscribed.

A. I like the beautiful photos of the houses for sale.
B. I always read the film reviews.
A. I never miss the food and drink section.

B. Shake it a couple of times.
A. I shook it. There is no more ink.
B. You can borrow mine.
A. Thank you. I'll buy a new one tomorrow.
B. What were you doing?
A. I was writing a letter.
B. Who were you writing to?
A. It's to my mom.
B. Tell her I said hello.
A. Okay. I'll return your pen when I'm done.

A. Have you done your homework?
B. Not yet.

A. Go do your homework.
B. But, mom!
A. You can watch TV after you do your homework.
B. But the show will be over.
A. There will be another show next week.

A. You know the rules.
B. I hate the rules! I can't wait till I grow up.

A. I can't wait until I graduate.
B. Me too.
A. No more homework.
B. I hate homework.
A. Are you going to college?
B. I can't afford it.
A. Me neither.
B. So what are you going to do?
A. I'm joining the army.
B. You're kidding. You might get killed.
A. I don't think so. After I finish, I'll have enough money to go to college.
B. That's not a bad idea.

A. What is your major?
B. English.
A. What are you going to do with an English major?

A. This is a huge library.
B. Yes, it has lots of rooms and lots of space.
A. And lots of books.
B. And lots of thieves.
A. What do you mean?
B. I mean, keep your belongings close to you.
A. The only thing in my backpack is used books.
B. But thieves don't know that.
A. They might think that I've got an iPod or laptop in there.
B. Now you're thinking.
A. You'd think a library would be safe from thieves.
B. Not even a church is safe from thieves.

A. How good is your math?
B. I can add two and two.
A. So you're not very good at math?
B. I'm terrible at math.
A. Well, I need some help.
B. With what?
A. I'm taking a math course in school.
B. Well, you should ask your teacher or your classmates for help.
A. I can't do that.
B. Why not?
A. They might think I'm stupid.
B. They're not going to think that! They'll be glad to help you.

A. Do you believe in God?
B. Of course.
A. Do you pray to God?

B. So what? They still drove off.
A. The husband said a fire department was nearby.
B. So what? Did he dial 911?
A. He said he was thinking about it, but he didn't get around to it.
B. He didn't get around to turning himself in, either.

A. I don't like riding the bus.
B. Why not?
A. The seats and windows are dirty.
B. Don't they clean the bus every night?
A. I think they do.
B. You should bring some wipes with you.
A. That's a good idea.
B. Then you can wipe your seat and window.
A. People will think I'm strange.
B. Who cares? Everyone is strange.
A. That's for sure.
B. Don't worry about what people think.

A. I don't like riding the bus.
B. Why not?
A. Number one, it's too slow.
B. You're right. A car is faster.
A. Number two, it's usually late.
B. You're right. The buses are never on time.
A. Number three, it doesn't run 24 hours.
B. You're right. Buses don't run late at night.
A. Number four, it's too crowded.
B. You're right. You have to stand in the aisle.

A. We had a problem at school.

A. I was crossing the street.
B. Were you in a crosswalk?
A. Yes, but the red hand was blinking.
B. So? That's a ticket?
A. Yes, it's a $140 ticket.
B. That's not right!
A. When I started to cross the street, the white walk sign was blinking.
B. You need to walk faster.

A. You're driving too fast.
B. Why do you say that?
A. The speed limit is 65.
B. I know that.
A. But you're doing 75.
B. So is everyone else.
A. But a cop might stop you.
B. No, he won't. Some cars are doing 85.
A. So the cop will stop those cars?

A. Remember to put air in your tires.
B. How often do I have to do that?
A. Once every two months.
B. That's a lot.
A. What do you mean?
B. That's six times a year!
A. Yes, and it takes about five minutes each time.
B. I'll try.
A. Check your tires or you'll get a flat.
B. Oh. That's not good.
A. No, it isn't. A flat costs you time and money.
B. And I don't have either.

A. You're driving too fast.
B. I'm in a hurry.
A. Don't ever be in a hurry.
B. It's not my fault. You didn't wake me up.
A. That's not my fault. You didn't tell me to wake you up.
B. Well, I meant to.
A. Don't ever be in a hurry when you're driving.
B. Why not?
A. Because you'll have an accident. Most accidents are because people are in a hurry.
B. How do you know that?
A. I read a lot.
B. I thought drunks caused most accidents.

A. Let's go for a ride.
B. Where are we going?
A. Into the mountains.
B. That sounds nice.
A. I want to show you my new car.
B. You bought a new car?

B. A luxury car.
A. Luxury plus speed.
B. What are we waiting for?
A. Let me get the keys.
B. Let me get my camera.

A. I have to go to the bathroom.
B. Why didn't you go before we left?
A. I did, but I have to go again.
B. Well, hold on a little longer.
A. I think I'm going to explode.
B. Just hold on.
A. Oh! Don't hit any more bumps!
B. We'll be at McDonald's in just a few minutes.
A. I hope they are fast minutes.
B. Think about something else. Think about a hamburger.
A. I'm thinking, but I still have to go.
B. It's the next exit. Hold on!

A. Where's the car?
B. What do you mean?
A. The car isn't here.
B. Where did you park it?
A. I parked it right here.
B. Are you sure?
A. Yes. I remember this big tree.
B. Maybe it's the wrong tree.
A. No, this is the tree.
B. Did someone steal it?
A. I sure hope not.
B. Maybe they towed it away.

A. Look at this traffic.
B. I'd rather not.
A. It gets worse every year.
B. Why are you complaining? We're going almost 20 miles an hour.
A. The speed limit is 65!
B. Well, that's between 2.00 and 4.00 a.m.
A. Where are all these people going?
B. They're all asking the same question.
A. When are they going to fix this problem?
B. They said they need more money.
A. They always need more money.
B. It'll get worse before it gets better.

A. Did you see that car?
B. Yes, he went through the red light.
A. Can we call the police?
B. No, the police don't care.
A. Why not?
B. They have to see it happen.
A. They don't believe us?
B. No. They can only give a ticket if they see it happen.
A. So, what do we do?
B. We don't do anything.
A. Maybe we should honk the horn next time.
B. The driver will just honk back at us.

A. My car is dirty.
B. Why don't you wash it?
A. That's what I'm going to do.
B. Are you going to wash it yourself?
A. Of course. It's not a hard job.
B. I'll help you.
A. Okay, I'll get a bucket.
B. I'll rinse the car first.
A. Then we can scrub it with a wet sponge and soap.
B. After that, we can dry it with a towel.
A. Then it will look like new
B. And you save $10.

A. It sure is windy today.
B. Paper is flying everywhere.
A. This wind is dangerous for drivers.
B. Especially for drivers of big trucks.
A. The wind blows those trucks over.
B. It blows trees over, too.
A. A tree fell onto my dad's car.
B. Was there much damage?
A. My dad had to buy a new car.
B. Wow! That's terrible.
A. Never park your car under a tree.
B. The wind will get you, or the birds will get you.

A. When are we going to stop?
B. We'll stop at the next McDonald's.
A. How far away is that?
B. I think we'll be there in half an hour.
A. I hope so. I have to go to the bathroom.
B. Well, I can always pull over.
A. No, thank you, I'll just wait.
B. We can kill two birds with one stone.
A. What do you mean?
B. While you're using the bathroom, I'll order some food.
A. Don't order for me. I'm not hungry.
B. I'm very hungry. I'll order for you, and then I'll eat yours.

A. This is such a long light.
B. Look how many cars are waiting in line.
A. They need a left-turn arrow.
B. Only two cars can make a left turn every three or four minutes.
A. We'll be here forever.
B. Get out of this lane.
A. But we need to turn left.
B. Forget it. Go straight.
A. Then what?
B. Then we'll just make a U-turn.
A. And then we can turn right at the light.
B. Good idea. It will be so much quicker.

A. I need a cheap car.
B. How much money do you have?
A. $1,000.
B. Well, that should get you something.
A. But I need something that's reliable.
B. You need a car with low mileage.
A. A car that was owned by a little old lady.
B. Where have you looked?
A. I haven't looked anywhere yet.
B. Why not?
A. Because I'll never find one for such a low price.
B. You're right about that. Keep saving your money.

A. Good afternoon, officer.
B. Your driver's license and registration, please.
A. Here you go.
B. Do you know why I pulled you over?
A. I have no idea. All of a sudden I heard your siren.
B. You rolled through that stop sign back there.
A. But I stopped!
B. No, you didn't. You slowed down, but you didn't come to a full stop.
A. Well, nobody else does, so why should I?
B. That's not the attitude of a good driver.
A. But I am a good driver. I've never had a ticket in my life.
B. Well, you've got one now. Here. Have a nice day.

A. $140. I can't believe it.
B. What are you talking about?
A. I got a ticket downtown for $140.
B. Were you speeding?
A. No, I was crossing the street.
B. Were you jaywalking?
A. No, I was in the crosswalk.
B. So why did you get a ticket?
A. The officer said the red hand was blinking.
B. Was it blinking when you entered the crosswalk?
A. No, the white WALK sign was blinking.
B. You should fight that ticket. I'll be your witness.

A. They were in a crosswalk near school at 3 a.m.
B. Who?
A. Two students from USC.
B. What happened?
A. A speeding car ran a red light, killing the girl.
B. What happened to the other student?
A. He landed on the hood of the car.
B. Did he get off the hood?
A. No, the car stopped and the passenger pushed the injured student off the hood.
B. I'll bet the car continued on its way.
A. Of course it did. Why stop after you've run over two people?
B. I hope they find them and put them in jail for life.

A. What happened to your car?
B. I got a dent in the parking lot.
A. How did you get it?
B. I don't know. Maybe it was from a shopping cart.
A. Those shopping carts are dangerous.
B. Especially the metal ones.
A. I don't park at a store that uses metal shopping carts.
B. That's a good idea, but there was a good sale at this store.
A. Did you save any money on the sale?
B. Yes, I did. I saved about $50.
A. That's great.
B. Yes, except this dent will cost about $150.

A. Did you see "Titanic"?
B. Yes. It is a great movie.
A. I saw it twelve times.
B. I saw it eight times.
A. I have the DVD.
B. So do I.
A. Let's go to your home.
B. We can watch my DVD.
A. And then we can go to my home.
B. And watch your DVD.
A. I always cry at the end.
B. Me too. It's so sad.

A. Let's play cards.
B. I don't know any card games.
A. I'll teach you one.
B. Okay. What will you teach me?
A. It's called poker.
B. Is it easy to learn?
A. Yes, it will only take about 30 minutes.
B. Okay. Teach me how to play.
A. We each get five cards.
B. Oh, look. I have four tens.
A. That's great, but you're not supposed to tell me.
B. Oh. Sorry. Okay, I don't have four tens.

A. I'm a good card player.
B. Why is that?
A. Because I watch the other players.
B. What do you mean?
A. People will tell you if they have a good hand.
B. How do they do that?
A. For example, a friend of mine licks his lips.
B. When he licks his lips, you know he has a good hand?
A. I know he has a good hand, so I don't bet.
B. He never wins your money?
A. Nope, and it drives him crazy.
B. He knows you can't read his mind. Maybe he thinks you're cheating.

A. Turn the radio down, please.
B. But I'm listening to it.
A. Well, listen to it more quietly.
B. I can't wait till I grow up.
A. What will you do?
B. I will play the radio as loud as I want.
A. That's okay with me.
B. I will have a radio in every room of my house.
A. Remind me to never visit you.
B. All the radios will be on extra loud.
A. Your neighbors will hate you.
B. If they don't like it, they can move.

A. I hope I win the lotto.
B. Your chances are very small.
A. But you can't win if you don't play.
B. Ha! You can't win if you do play.
A. Someone has to win.
B. That's what everyone says.
A. It might as well be me.
B. That's what everyone says.
A. You're trying to tell me something.
B. That didn't take long.
A. You think I should quit playing.
B. Save your money for school.

A. What's on TV?
B. Nothing much.
A. What about the baseball game?
B. It got rained out.
A. Rained out?
B. Yes, rained out.
A. How could that be?
B. Well, you can't play baseball in a rainstorm.
A. I thought they were playing under a dome.
B. The dome doesn't close.
A. Why doesn't it close?
B. Who knows? They said they'll fix it before next season.

A. Can I try your coffee?
B. Sure. Here you go.
A. Hmm, that's not bad.
B. There's nothing in it.
A. What do you mean?
B. I mean, it's just coffee.
A. I figured that.
B. It's not too bitter for you?
A. It's a little bitter, but it's okay.
B. There's no sugar or cream in it.
A. No, it's a taste you have to get used to.
B. Sort of like beer.

A. Let's take a walk.
B. What's the weather like?
A. Let me step outside and see.
B. It's a little chilly, right?
A. Yes, it is.
B. I'll put on my cap.
A. Wear a jacket, too.
B. I wonder if I should bring my gloves.
A. Maybe you should, just in case it gets colder.
B. I'll put a glove in each pocket.
A. We'll get warmer as we walk.
B. Yes, but it gets colder as the sun goes down.

A. Look at the car chase on TV!
B. That driver is crazy.
A. I can't believe he hasn't crashed.
B. How fast is he going?
A. They say he's going 80 miles per hour.
B. He's going to kill someone.
A. Look! He just hit that car.
B. Oh, my goodness. No one is safe on the streets.
A. Now he's slowing down.
B. Maybe he ran out of gas.
A. Look! He just got out of the car and started running.
B. I hope the police catch him.

A. TV news is so stupid.
B. They shouldn't even call it news.
A. Last night they told us about a cat in a sofa.
B. Yesterday they told us about a dog in a pipe.
A. Last week they told us about a bear in a back yard.
B. Last month they told us about a mouse in a restaurant.
A. The weatherman tells us the temperature in every town.
B. The sports guy shows us players fighting.
A. They always tell us "what's next."
B. They always make "what's next" sound exciting, but it never is.
A. It's more like news for kids.
B. They should have kid reporters.

A. I love my computer.
B. Computers are so cool.
A. I love to go online.
B. The Internet is amazing.
A. You can travel all over the world.
B. I know. I went to China yesterday.
A. What did you do?
B. I stood on the Great Wall and looked all around.
A. What was it like?
B. It was like the real thing.
A. It was like being there?
B. Yes, I felt like I was actually there.

A. The Beatles are the best.
B. They are the best musical group ever.
A. I love all their songs.
B. I don't know which one I like the best.
A. I like the ones I can sing along with.
B. So do I, like "She Loves You."
A. "She loves you, Yeah, yeah, yeah!..."
B. "…And you know you should be glad!"
A. What a great song.
B. How about "Let It Be?"
A. Oh, yes! "Let it be, let it be…"
B. "…There will be an answer, let it be!"

A. Let's go to a movie.
B. I'd rather not.
A. Why not?
B. You know I don't like crowds.
A. Let's go to an early movie.
B. Okay, that won't be very crowded.
A. What would you like to see?
B. Oh, I don't care. You're the one who wants to go out.
A. Well, I want to see "The Pursuit of Happyness."
B. What have you heard about it?
A. It's based on a true story about a divorced man and his young son.
B. Well, I hope it has a happy ending.

A. What's your favorite thing to do?
B. I like to watch people.
A. That's your favorite thing to do?
B. Well, it's one of them.
A. Where do you go to watch people?
B. My girlfriend and I sit outside Starbucks.
A. That sounds like a good spot.
B. We watch people walk by with their dogs.
A. I guess you see lots of different dogs.
B. We don't even know what kind most of them are.
A. There are lots of different kinds, but they all have one thing in common.
B. Yes, they love to sniff each other when they meet.

A. They call him Father Dollar Bill.
B. Yes, he was on the TV news today.
A. Every Easter Sunday he gives away money.
B. Is it his money?
A. No. Movie stars give him money to give to homeless people.
B. How much money does he give away?
A. This year he gave away $15,000.
B. That's a lot of money.
A. He gave $100 to people in wheelchairs.
B. What about the other homeless people?
A. They got $1 each.
B. People stood in line just to get one dollar?!

A. Old movies are the best.
B. Even though they're in black and white.
A. A good story is more important than color.
B. Actors didn't curse back then.
A. And there was no violence.
B. People today don't like that.
A. No, today people like lots of action.
B. I like a good story.
A. I like to see actors who are like real people.
B. Like real people with real problems.
A. They still make movies like that.
B. Yes, but they never make much money.

A. Do you get PBS on TV?
B. Yes, everybody gets the Public Broadcasting System.
A. It puts me to sleep.
B. Tell me about it.
A. A gardening show follows a knitting show.
B. A cooking show follows a sewing show.
A. A travel show follows another travel show.
B. I'll say! I've gone around the world a dozen times already!
A. Now they're adding old TV shows to the old movies.
B. I sure would like to see something interesting for a change.
A. If more people donate money, PBS could offer new shows.
B. Who wants to donate? Public TV should be free.

A. I love to watch "Judge Judy."
B. Is that a TV show?
A. Yes. It's on every afternoon.
B. What's so good about it?
A. They have interesting lawsuits.
B. Such as?
A. Yesterday, a woman complained about a cell phone she bought on eBay.
B. Was something wrong with the phone?
A. It works only in Canada.
B. Did the seller know that?
A. Yes, and he didn't tell the buyer.
B. I hope Judge Judy made the seller take the phone back.

A. That woman is a very good singer.
B. Yes, but she looks like a man.
A. What difference does it make?
B. Female singers are supposed to be pretty.
A. Singers are supposed to sound good.
B. They should look good, too.
A. There are lots of ugly men singers.
B. Men singers don't have to look good.
A. Then neither do women singers.
B. Well, I would never buy her CD.
A. But you would buy her CD if she was pretty?
B. Yes. I would buy all of her CDs.

A. All the TV stations are going to go digital.
B. Yes, that will occur next month.
A. Most of them are already broadcasting in digital.
B. The digital signal is very clear.
A. Oh, no, it isn't!
B. What do you mean?
A. I can't get a single channel.
B. Do you have a digital TV?
A. Of course. But I don't have cable.
B. You don't need to have cable, but you do need a good antenna.
A. But I have rabbit ears.
B. Rabbit ears aren't strong enough. Buy a digital antenna.

A. I've got a date for you.
B. Oh, really?
A. Are you interested?
B. Maybe. What is she like?
A. She's got a great personality.
B. Uh-oh. That means that she's fat and ugly.
A. She's cute.
B. Okay, so she's not ugly; she's just fat.
A. She weighs 98 pounds.
B. Okay, she's not fat. So what's the problem with her?
A. Who said there is a problem with her?
B. The problem is she has no problems—she's too good for me!

A. I think you're very pretty.
B. Thank you.
A. Would you have dinner with me?
B. I would like to.
A. Can I pick you up Friday night?
B. What time?
A. Eight o'clock.
B. That sounds great.
A. We'll go to a French restaurant.
B. I've never been to a French restaurant.
A. I think you'll love the food.
B. I'm not going to eat any snails!

A. You have pretty eyes.
B. Thank you. So do you.
A. I wish my eyes were blue.
B. What's the matter with green eyes?
A. Nothing, except my favorite color is blue.
B. Maybe in your next life you'll have blue eyes.
A. But what if I'm a fish in my next life?
B. I think some fish have blue eyes.
A. I hope I don't come back as a fish.
B. I hope I come back as a cat.
A. Cats have beautiful eyes.
B. I would love to have blue cat-eyes.

A. I love you.
B. I love you, too.
A. I loved you the first day I saw you.
B. It was love at first sight?
A. Yes, it was love at first sight.
B. I didn't love you at first.
A. I know. I had to chase you for a while.
B. Yes, you chased me and then you caught me.
A. Now you're mine forever.
B. And you're mine forever.
A. We'll grow old together.
B. And be happy together.

A. I'm in love with that girl.
B. Have you told her?
A. Of course not.
B. Why not?
A. She would laugh at me.
B. How do you know?
A. Because they always do.
B. Maybe she's different.
A. They're all the same.
B. Just ask her out to dinner.
A. And then what?
B. And then she'll know that you like her.

A. Give me a hug.
B. I'm not in the mood.
A. What's the matter?
B. I saw you looking at that woman.
A. What woman?
B. You know, that woman with the big boobs.
A. I was not looking at her.
B. You were, too.
A. I'm not interested in her.
B. Then why were you looking at her?
A. I was looking at something else.
B. Oh, really? Then spend tonight looking at the sofa.

A. Would you like to go on a blind date?
B. You must be joking.
A. No, I'm serious.
B. I don't want to date a blind woman.
A. A blind date doesn't mean that she is blind!
B. What does it mean?
A. A blind date is a date with someone you don't know.
B. Why would I date someone I don't even know?
A. To try something new and exciting.
B. What if I don't like her?
A. Then you don't date her again.

A. I have a date tomorrow night.
B. Really? Who with?
A. A girl I met at the market.
B. You met a girl at the supermarket?
A. She was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter.
B. What did you say to her?
A. I had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where I had found them.
B. She asked you about your pineapples?
A. I told her I had gotten the last two on the shelf, but I offered her one of mine.
B. That was nice of you.
A. She asked me how she could return the favor, so I asked her out.
B. Sometimes a slow line can be a good thing.

A. Did you have a date Friday night?
B. Yes, in fact, I did.
A. Who did you go out with?
B. A man I met in a coffee shop.
A. Where did you go?
B. We went to a nice restaurant.
A. Anywhere else?
B. Then we went to a jazz club.
A. That sounds like a nice date.
B. Yes, it was pleasant.
A. But you won't date him again?
B. No. He was nice, but there was no chemistry.

A. I had the worst date the other night.
B. What happened?
A. First of all, he was half an hour late.
B. That's not a good start.
A. Then he didn't bother to apologize.
B. That's rude.
A. Then he drove too fast to the restaurant.
B. That's dangerous.
A. I thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.
B. What happened at the restaurant?
A. We had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip!
B. I guess you can't go back to that restaurant.

A. I don't like that man.
B. Why not?
A. He's a dirty old man.
B. What do you mean?
A. He's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out.
B. Well, you can't blame a man for asking.
A. He should act his age.
B. But a lot of old people are still interested in dating.
A. They should find a nice hobby.
B. Just wait until you're 50 years old.
A. Dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.
B. That's what you say now. Wait till you're 50.

A. Does your girlfriend ever make you angry?
B. Sometimes.
A. What does she do?
B. Just yesterday, I told her I wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world.
A. That was a nice thing to say.
B. That's what I thought.
A. What did she say?
B. She laughed! She didn't believe me.
A. That wasn't very nice of her.
B. She said that nothing is more important to me than money.
A. What did you say?
B. I told her I wouldn't trade her for any other woman in the world.

A. Some people have good noses.
B. I wish I had a good nose. Mine is way too big.
A. I don't mean good-looking. I mean good-smelling.
B. Oh. But that can be a curse.
A. Yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors.
B. I'll say. My girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.
A. Did she catch you using drugs?
B. Sort of. She knows whenever I sneak a cigarette.
A. You don't need a good nose for that—cigarettes stink.
B. But when I sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!
A. Boy, that is a good nose.
B. I told her she should apply for a job at customs.

A. Let's go out to eat.
B. That sounds like fun.
A. Where do you want to go?
B. Let me think a minute.
A. I feel like Chinese.
B. That sounds delicious.
A. I know a good Chinese restaurant.
B. How far away is it?
A. It's only 10 minutes from here.
B. Do we need reservations?
A. Oh, no. We can walk right in.
B. Let's go now. I'm hungry!

A. I can't believe how long this line is.
B. This is a popular restaurant, isn't it?
A. Yes, but it isn't a fast-food restaurant, is it?
B. It's the slowest hamburger in town.
A. That's because they cook it while you wait.
B. Yes. That's why it's also the best hamburger in town.
A. A great burger and great service.
B. Yes, the workers are very polite.
A. And they're clean.
B. I've been coming here for years.
A. Me too.
B. Excuse me. They just called my number.

A. Lunch was delicious.
B. Thank you.
A. What kind of soup was that?
B. It was tomato soup.
A. That tasted so good.
B. I put lemon and butter in it.
A. The sandwich was good, too.
B. Everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches.
A. Especially on toast.
B. And the pickles were great, too.
A. Tomorrow we'll have rice and fish for lunch.
B. I can't wait.

A. I'm calling the waiter.
B. What's the matter?
A. This steak has too much fat.
B. What do you want the waiter to do?
A. Bring me a better steak.
B. I wouldn't do that.
A. Why not?
B. They will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it.
A. You're crazy.
B. Then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.
A. Where do you get these crazy ideas?
B. I used to cook in a restaurant!

A. Let's leave.
B. But we just got here.
A. Did you see the waiter's hands?
B. No.
A. He had dirty fingernails.
B. Really?
A. His nails were black!
B. That's disgusting.
A. And he poured water into our glasses.
B. Yuck! No water for me.
A. I wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty, too.
B. Who cares? Let's get out of here.

A. This hot bread is delicious.
B. I like this restaurant because they give you free bread.
A. Well, I think we are paying for it.
B. No. Look at the bill when we get it. There's no charge for the bread.
A. It is delicious, especially with butter.
B. I think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.
A. They probably wouldn't like that.
B. I'm eating so much bread that I'm getting full.
A. Then stop eating the bread!
B. Okay, just one more piece. Pass the butter, please.
A. If I owned a restaurant, I would never serve hot bread before the main course.
B. That's terrible. I would never go to your restaurant.

A. Is this a clean restaurant?
B. Well, the tables and chairs look okay.
A. Okay, let's sit down.
B. Check out the silverware.
A. It passes inspection.
B. Here comes the waiter. See if his hands and nails are clean.
A. Well, the waiter looked clean, so I guess it's okay to eat here.
B. You're forgetting about the bathroom.
A. I'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.
B. You're not going to examine it before we order dinner?
A. No, I'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because I'm pretty hungry right now.
B. Me, too. Let's forget about germs and focus on food.

A. Have you seen our waiter?
B. Here he comes now.
A. We've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.
B. Oops, I guess I was wrong. That isn't our waiter.
A. We can give him five more minutes, and then leave.
B. I'll go up front and talk to the manager.
A. That's a good idea.
B. Maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.
A. Maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.
B. Every time we eat out, it's an adventure.
A. Last time, we got seats next to the kitchen.
B. We'll never go there again.

A. Is this table okay?
B. No, it's too close to the kitchen door.
A. How about this table?
B. No, it's too close to the front door.
A. This looks like a nice table.
B. No, it's too close to the salad bar.
A. Okay, I give up.
B. Well, there is one good table.
A. Great. Which one?
B. That one. A group of eight just sat down at it.

A. I don't believe the art world.
B. What is it this time?
A. An Andy Warhol drawing.
B. He's a famous artist.
A. He drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.
B. Did he sign it?
A. Yes.
B. Is it beautiful?
A. It's just black ink on a white napkin. And the napkin has food stains!
B. So it's not worth much?
A. Only about $30,000.
B. Without the food stains, it would probably be worth more.

A. Can we go to the baseball game?
B. Of course.
A. I love baseball.
B. So do I.
A. I love to eat the peanuts.
B. I love to eat the hot dogs.
A. I hope we’ll see a home run.
B. I hope we’ll catch a foul ball.
A. Bring a jacket.
B. Yes. It gets a little cool at night.
A. Bring a glove to catch a foul ball.
B. No. I’ll just use my cap to catch a foul ball.

A. Golf is a silly game.
B. It certainly is.
A. You hit a white ball.
B. And then you chase it.
A. And then you hit it again.
B. Finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground.
A. You do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes.
B. What’s the point?
A. How can it be fun?
B. They pay money to play this silly game!
A. I think golfers have a mental problem.
B. I think they’re nuts.

A. Do you want to go fishing?
B. Yes. That’s a good idea.
A. Where do you want to go?
B. We can go to the river.
A. Or we can go to the lake.
B. Or we can go to the ocean.
A. Let’s go to the lake.
B. Yes. The lake is only 10 miles away.
A. We can be there in 20 minutes.
B. I’ll get our fishing rods.
A. I’ll get the bait.
B. We’ll have fresh fish for dinner!

A. Baseball is fun.
B. I like to hit the ball.
A. I like to run around the bases.
B. I like to slide into the bases.
A. Yeah. It’s a lot of fun to slide.
B. I want to be a baseball player when I grow up.
A. Me too. I want to play for the Yankees.
B. Not me. I want to play for the Dodgers.
A. We have to practice every day.
B. I don’t like practice.
A. Me neither. It’s boring.
B. But practice makes perfect.

A. Let’s go jogging.
B. That’s a good idea.
A. I bought some new shoes.
B. Are they comfortable?
A. They’re very comfortable.
B. How much were they?
A. They were on sale for $80.
B. Do they help you run faster?
A. No, but my feet don’t hurt anymore.
B. Then they’re worth every penny.
A. You might want to buy a pair.
B. I’ll wait until I wear this pair out.

A. Tiger is the greatest golfer in the world.
B. You can say that again.
A. But I’m worried about Tiger.
B. Why is that?
A. Because he likes to SCUBA dive.
B. What’s wrong with that?
A. It can be dangerous.
B. You mean he could drown.
A. He shouldn’t SCUBA dive until he retires.
B. But he dives to relax.
A. He might relax, but it makes me nervous.
B. If his wife doesn’t mind, you shouldn’t mind.

A. Did you watch that golf tournament?
B. The one that Tiger won?
A. How did he do it?
B. It was nothing for him.
A. He sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!
B. He sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.
A. I think he is from outer space.
B. No human could possibly play golf that well.
A. Whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot.
B. No human can do that.
A. Somebody should check his birth record.
B. I bet it says he was born on Mars.

A. Who’s the greatest baseball player?
B. There are so many great players.
A. Yes, but who is the greatest?
B. I’d have to say Babe Ruth.
A. Most people would say that.
B. He changed the game.
A. Yes, he made the home run popular.
B. Everybody loved him, all over the nation.
A. He helped make the Yankees the best team ever.
B. And Ruth was a good person, too.
A. He always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.
B. There will never be another Babe.

A. Did you hear what happened at the baseball game?
B. No, please tell me.
A. Someone punched out someone.
B. That’s not nice.
A. It’s worse than that.
B. How so?
A. Two guys got into an argument.
B. I’ll bet they were drinking.
A. A third guy punched one of the two guys.
B. I’ll bet he was drinking, too.

B. What did you do?
A. I bought some stock.
B. Everybody buys stock.

A. I was going to be a doctor.
B. What happened to your plans?
A. I got a D in college chemistry.

A. And now I'm glad that I didn't.
B. Why's that?
A. A hospital is the most dangerous place in the world.
B. Oh, yes, because of all the killer germs.

A. And you get to play with a lot of dogs.
B. Well, you're supposed to be working.
A. Yes, but I will always pet the friendly dogs.
B. What about the unfriendly dogs?
A. I think if you are friendly to dogs, they are friendly to you.
B. Dogs are like people—not all of them are friendly.

A. I want to move to New York.
B. To the state or the city?
A. To the city, of course.
B. Why do you want to move there?
A. Because I want to make a lot of money.
B. There are a lot of poor people in New York.
A. There sure are—at least a million.
B. So how do you plan to become rich?
A. I will knock on the doors of all the corporations.

B. Yes. A cow is man's best friend.

A. I used to work in a deli.
B. How did you like it?
A. I loved it!
B. Did you get free food?
A. I ate free cheese and meat every day.
B. That sounds like a great job.
A. Whatever a customer ordered, I sliced off a little more for me.
B. Did you get fat?
A. No, but I did put on a few pounds.
B. That sounds like a dream job.
A. It was, until one day my manager caught me.
B. No more free cheese for you, huh?

A. I'm on a new diet.
B. What are you eating now?
A. I switched from pasta to potatoes.
B. Why did you do that?
A. Pasta is processed food. Potatoes are natural food.
B. Natural food has more vitamins.
A. And it's just as easy to prepare.
B. How do you prepare the potatoes?
A. I wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes.
B. That's pretty simple.
A. Then I add butter, salt, and pepper.
B. Can I have all those cans of tomato sauce you bought for your pasta?

A. My girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table.
B. Why was that?
A. I sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before I tasted it.
B. What's the matter with that?
A. Her mom is a great cook.
B. So, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything.
A. It hurt her feelings.
B. Oh.
A. I apologized to her, but I could tell she was still upset.
B. Maybe you shouldn't eat there again.
A. I'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.
B. It's your girlfriend's fault. She should have warned you.

A. I eat the same thing every day.
B. You're kidding.
A. No, I'm serious.
B. Doesn't that get old?
A. No, because I'm eating food that I like.
B. But the same thing day after day gets old.
A. Well, I guess if it ever does get old, I'll change to something different.
B. Do you eat fruits and vegetables every day?
A. No, I hate vegetables.
B. But you eat fruits.
A. I eat two apples, one banana, and one orange every day.
B. Well, there's nothing wrong with that.

A. There's something wrong with my orange.
B. What's wrong?
A. It's not orange!
B. Your orange isn't orange?
A. No, it's dark pink!
B. Are you sure? I never heard of such a thing.
A. I just peeled it, and I'm looking at it right now.
B. Let me see. Yes, you're right. Your orange is pink.
A. Who ever heard of such a thing?
B. Oh, look. Here's the little sticker that was on it. It's called a Pink Navel.
A. What is this world coming to?
B. Who knows? Maybe soon we'll have pink bananas.

A. I love peanuts.
B. Me, too. I love them roasted and salted.
A. I love boiled peanuts.
B. Boiled? I never heard of that.
A. Just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.
B. I'll have to try them sometime.
A. They're best when they're hot.
B. My brother is allergic to peanuts.
A. That's not good.
B. No, it isn't. He almost died when he was little.
A. I guess he has to be very careful about what he eats.
B. He has a very strict diet.

A. I'm gaining weight.
B. How much have you gained?
A. Three pounds just this month.
B. Do you know why?
A. I think it's the ice cream.
B. You started eating ice cream?
A. It was on sale.
B. How much did you buy?
A. I filled up my freezer with ice cream.
B. Well, it won't last forever.
A. No, I figure I'll finish it all by next week.
B. Then you can start losing weight, if there isn't another sale.

A. I'm stuffed.
B. Of course you are. You ate everything on the table.
A. I don't like to eat leftovers.
B. I'm glad to hear there's something you don't like to eat.
A. I like my food hot and fresh.
B. You like to see it disappear.
A. I don't like it reheated.
B. Well, you'll have hot fresh food tomorrow night.
A. I'm so full I'm going to burst.
B. You should loosen your belt.
A. I already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants.
B. Well, don't stand up, please.

A. I saw what you did.
B. I didn't do anything.
A. Oh yes, you did.
B. What are you talking about?
A. You know what I'm talking about.
B. I don't have any idea.
A. You know what you did.
B. Maybe I know, but how could you know?
A. Because I was watching you.
B. Okay, I'm sorry I did it.
A. Don't drink milk out of the carton. Use a glass!
B. I promise I'll never drink out of the carton again.

A. I like that shirt.
B. So do I.
A. How much is it?
B. I don't know. The tag is missing.
A. Ask the clerk.
B. I will.
A. Oh, look. Here's another shirt just like it.
B. Does it have a price tag?
A. Yes, it does. It's only $20.
B. That's a great price.
A. I think I'll buy both of them.
B. You'd better try them on first.

A. I bought you a pair of pants.
B. Thank you.
A. I hope they fit.
B. I hope you kept the receipt.
A. You think they won't fit?
B. I think I've put on some weight.
A. You think?
B. Maybe a pound or two.
A. Maybe four or five pounds?
B. My waist is bigger than it was.
A. No problem. These pants have an elastic waistband.
B. You are so smart!

A. What do we need to buy?
B. Let me look at our list.
A. I know that we need milk.
B. Nonfat.
A. Of course. What else?
B. We need cheese, bread, and ham.
A. What kind of cheese?
B. Swiss.
A. Of course, the cheese with holes in it.
B. I never used to buy Swiss cheese.
A. Why not?
B. I didn't want to pay for the holes.

A. I need some pants.
B. I thought you just bought a pair.
A. I did.
B. What's wrong with them so soon?
A. The pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it.
B. You shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.
A. But that's what pockets are for.
B. You should carry them in a purse.
A. I'm a man, and men don't carry purses!
B. Well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets.
A. I would if I could find someone who makes strong pockets.
B. Try a Google search online.

A. What are those wipes for?
B. You use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.
A. That's a great idea.
B. Yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers.
A. I'm going to take five wipes.
B. What do you need five of them for?
A. One to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce.
B. What's the matter with the produce?
A. Do you think the bananas fell from the sky?
B. What do you mean?
A. I mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas, the apples, and the oranges.
B. Well, you better save a wipe for the dirty dollar bills you're going to pay with.

A. Did you go to the 99 Cents store?
B. Yes, I did.
A. What did you buy?
B. Well, I got a lot of good deals, as usual.
A. Like what?
B. Well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents.
A. That's a good deal.
B. And a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.
A. Another good deal.
B. But the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.
A. I don't know how that store makes money.
B. Neither do I, but they're doing something right.

A. I need a new computer.
B. What's the matter with yours?
A. It's six years old.
B. That's pretty old.
A. It still works, but I'm going to give it to a charity.
B. Are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?
A. Oh, a laptop, of course.
B. A PC or a Mac?
A. I haven't decided yet.
B. More and more people are using Macs.
A. But 90 percent of the world uses PCs.
B. And that's not going to change anytime soon.

A. I got ripped off.
B. What happened?
A. I had a car problem, so I went online.
B. Did you find a solution?
A. Yes, I did. A site I went to said they would send me the solution.
B. So, what's the problem?
A. I sent them $20 using my credit card, but they never sent me the solution.
B. What are you going to do?
A. I sent them an email asking for my money back.
B. Have you heard from them?
A. Not yet. It's been a week.
B. Well, I guess that's a $20 lesson for you.

A. Where's the pencil sharpener?
B. Which one?
A. Any one. I need to sharpen this pencil.
B. I think there's one on the dining room table.
A. I already looked there.
B. Did you look in the desk drawer?
A. Yes, I looked there, too.
B. Don't we have about five sharpeners?
A. Yes, but they seem to have legs.
B. Tomorrow I'm going to buy an electric sharpener.
A. Get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.
B. Yes. That way it will stay where I put it.

A. I'm trying to stretch my dollars.
B. How are you doing that?
A. I started shopping at the dollar store.
B. That saves a lot of money.
A. I bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.
B. That's a good deal.
A. Yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.
B. Just put them in the fridge.
A. Also, I bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.
B. Why did you do that?
A. I mixed them together.
B. If the coffee still tastes okay, that's a good idea.

A. I really like this house.
B. Can we afford it?
A. They want 20 percent down.
B. That's a lot of money.
A. But the house is so nice.
B. It's in a great neighborhood.
A. It's close to the beach.
B. It's close to the freeways.
A. It's got a big yard.
B. The kids love the house, too.
A. If we don't buy it, someone else will.
B. You're right. Let's buy it now. We can worry later.

A. We can't afford this house.
B. Are you sure?
A. We will be house rich, but cash poor.
B. What do you mean?
A. Our monthly payments will be too high.
B. We won't have any money for other things?
A. No, we won't have money for gas or food.
B. We'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?
A. Without the peanut butter!
B. That's no good!
A. We have to find a cheaper house.
B. Of course. We can't live without gas or peanut butter.

A. That is a beautiful house.
B. I don't like it.
A. What's the matter with it?
B. It's on the corner.
A. So?
B. That means it gets twice as much traffic.
A. You're right.
B. When you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection.
A. Or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.
B. Or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.
A. Let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.
B. That's perfect. The less traffic, the better.

A. I hate looking for an apartment.
B. Me, too.
A. We have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on Main Street.
B. We'd better get ready to go.
A. It's an upstairs unit.
B. That's good, because I don't want to live under people with loud feet.
A. And it's a corner unit.
B. That's great. We won't have neighbors on both sides of us.
A. No pets are allowed.
B. Perfect. We don't have to listen to barking dogs.
A. And there are only six units in the whole building.
B. Where's the checkbook? I'm ready to rent it without even seeing it.

A. Did you call the manager?
B. Yes. He said he'd come over tomorrow.
A. Did he say what time?
B. Yes. He said he'd be here at 9 o'clock.
A. Did he understand what the problem is?
B. Yes. I told him our doorbell doesn't work.
A. It shouldn't take him long to fix it.
B. I don't even know why we need to fix it.
A. In case we have visitors.
B. But they can just knock on the door.
A. Actually, I want him to look at our carpet, too.
B. Yes, it would be nice if he'd give us a new carpet.

A. Do you like this house?
B. Yes, it's beautiful.
A. It's perfect for us and the kids.
B. Three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard.
A. And we can afford it!
B. So are we going to buy it?
A. I'm afraid not.
B. It's too far from your job, isn't it?
A. I can't spend four hours on the road every day.
B. By the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat.
A. I won't be able to play with the kids.
B. No, we have to find something closer to your job.

A. Boy, it's chilly outside, isn't it?
B. It sure is.
A. In fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too.
B. Let's turn on the heat.
A. I'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut.
B. It should be warmer in a few minutes.
A. It's so nice to have a heated apartment.
B. How did they survive in the old days?
A. They had fireplaces.
B. Someone had to chop the wood.
A. And carry it into the house.
B. All we have to do is flip a switch.

A. This is a nice neighborhood.
B. The streets are clean and quiet.
A. The neighbors don't party on the weekends.
B. People take care of their lawns.
A. No rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards.
B. We never have to call the police about anything.
A. Our kids are completely safe.
B. So why are we selling our house?
A. They're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner.
B. So we've got to sell before property values go down?
A. Yes. I still can't believe our city council allowed this building.
B. They're probably getting something under the table.

A. That was a huge fire in Santa Barbara.
B. Yes, it was.
A. They said about 30 houses burned to the ground.
B. And they were expensive houses.
A. I feel so sorry for those people.
B. Why feel sorry for rich people?
A. I feel sorry for anyone who loses their home.
B. So do I, but not if they're rich.
A. What does that have to do with it?
B. Rich people think they're better than us.
A. How many rich people do you know?
B. None.

A. Bears are invading our neighborhoods.
B. Of course they are. They're starving to death.
A. They should stay in the woods where they belong.
B. There's no food in the woods.
A. Can't they eat grass?
B. Do you think a bear is a cow?
A. Well, I've seen them eating berries.
B. Berries aren't in season all year round.
A. It's too dangerous for kids and pets.
B. People need to cover their trash cans.
A. The police need to shoot all the bears.
B. You don't solve a problem by shooting it.

A. Who did you vote for?
B. I voted for Obama.
A. Me too.
B. He will be a great president.
A. Everyone likes him.
B. He's a good speaker.
A. And he's really smart.
B. He will solve our problems.
A. He will end the war.
B. The next four years will be good years.
A. I'll vote for him next time, too.
B. I think everyone will.

A. The election is next week.
B. Who are you voting for?
A. I'm not voting for the mayor.
B. Why not?
A. He made promises that he didn't keep.
B. Like what?
A. He promised to hire 1,000 more police officers.
B. How many did he hire?
A. One hundred!
B. Maybe he had a good reason.
A. Maybe he's just a liar.
B. Maybe I'll vote for someone else, too.

A. I can't believe he won the election.
B. Only 15 percent of the voters turned out.
A. That is a joke.
B. Voting is so important, but people don't bother.
A. Many people think their vote doesn't matter.
B. The mayor won by only 2,000 votes.
A. We're stuck with him for four more years.
B. Voting is so easy. You can even mail your ballot in.
A. All you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.
B. How easy is that?
A. I guess people just don't care.
B. They'll care when they see their taxes go up.

A. Well, we have a new president.
B. But we have the same old problems.
A. Well, he's made a few changes.
B. Like what?
A. I think he closed the bowling alley in the White House.
B. Oh, yeah. He's changing it to a basketball court.
A. Who's paying for that?
B. I think we are!
A. Well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.
B. Yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly.
A. Do any other world leaders have a basketball court?
B. They will. You know America always leads the way.

A. People say that everybody loves Obama.
B. Well, more than 50 million people voted for McCain.
A. That's 50 million people who don't love Obama.
B. Obama's got four years to make everyone happy.
A. He's never going to make everyone happy.
B. Can you imagine being President?
A. Everyone wants you to solve their problems.
B. I have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.
A. You and everybody else.
B. I would never want to be President.
A. But think about all the power you'd have.
B. I prefer my quiet little life to all the power in the world.

A. Did you read this article?
B. What article?
A. It says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties.
B. Only 11 percent?
A. About 50 percent of the time he's traveling.
B. Where does he travel to?
A. Oh, all over the world.
B. But he's supposed to be making our city a better place.
A. He's visiting other cities to get ideas.
B. Can't he just go online?
A. The rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.
B. Well, he'll never get reelected once this news gets out.

A. Who did you vote for for president?
B. I voted for Ralph Nader.
A. Who in the world is Ralph Nader?
B. He's the best man for president.
A. Why's that?
B. He hates corporations.
A. Well, most corporations do think only about money.
B. He hates Democrats and Republicans.
A. Well, they do put their party before their country.
B. He's the only candidate that I trust.
A. But he didn't have a chance. Nobody voted for him!
B. Sooner or later, voters will wake up.

A. I don't know why I bother to vote.
B. Why's that?
A. What good does it do?
B. You get to put someone in power that you like.
A. Only if my candidate wins.
B. Well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him.
A. But even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises.
B. That's true. They promise anything just so they get elected.
A. And when elected, they go their own way.
B. They forget who put them in power.
A. They forget where they came from.
B. Maybe you should run for office.

A. That election for U.S. Senator stunk.
B. What do you mean?
A. There were more votes than voters!
B. But that's impossible.
A. Officials said that it's possible.
B. Did they explain how it's possible?
A. No. They said there are some things you can't explain.
B. So are they going to hold another election?
A. No. That will cost too much money.
B. So it's better to save money than to have an honest election?
A. Well, the Democratic Party says it was an honest election.
B. Of course they say that—their man won!

A. I see that former President Bush is at a conference.
B. Yes. He's telling jokes about his eight years as president.
A. Yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone.
B. Only 4,000 American soldiers were killed overseas.
A. Not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers.
B. But Bush visited some of them in the hospital once.
A. That's nice that he found the time to make a visit.
B. He spoke to them and made them feel better.
A. Did he speak to every family that lost a soldier?
B. No, he didn't have time to do that.
A. Well, he's got plenty of time now!
B. No, he's too busy writing a book about how hard it was to be president.

A. Did you get your Official Sample Ballot?
B. Yes, with the Voter Instructions.
A. How are you going to vote?
B. Same as ever, by mail. All it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.
A. I meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?
B. Against all of them, of course.
A. But we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons.
B. We've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!
A. That's true. Where did that money go?
B. Our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.
A. They are having a good time with our money.
B. So when are we going to stop giving them more?

A. Have you decided how you are going to vote?
B. Do you mean on Measures 1, 2, and 3?
A. Yes. The ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals.
B. You mean the measures that will raise our taxes.
A. But the TV ads say that our taxes will not increase.
B. Do you believe the TV ads?
A. I like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote Yes.
B. Don't believe him! Whatever the TV ads tell you, the opposite is true.
A. But the title of Measure 1 is "Better Schools at No Cost."
B. The title should be "Better Schools at Huge Cost."
A. I can't believe that they would lie to us.
B. Of course they lie—that's what politicians do!

A. I have a stomachache.
B. Is it something you ate?
A. Maybe. I'm not sure.
B. What did you have for breakfast?
A. The usual, cereal with milk and a banana.
B. Maybe the milk was bad.
A. It didn't smell bad.
B. Maybe the banana was bad.
A. No, the banana was delicious.
B. Maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.
A. No, that's not the problem.
B. Maybe it will go away in a little while.

A. What's this stain?
B. I don't know.
A. It looks like blood.
B. I think my nose was bleeding.
A. You should wet your shirt immediately.
B. Why?
A. Because that gets the blood out of the shirt.
B. What's a little blood?
A. Your white shirt is ruined.
B. So, I'll just buy another one.
A. You can wear this one around the house.
B. Next time I'll soak it immediately.

A. My fingers hurt.
B. Why do they hurt?
A. I type too much.
B. You should take a break.
A. I need to type to make money.
B. But typing is causing you pain.
A. Maybe I should see a doctor.
B. Doctors are too expensive.
A. He might tell me to rest for a while.
B. He might want to cut you open.
A. He might say I'm okay.
B. He might say you have bone cancer.

A. What did the doctor say?
B. He thinks I have too much stress.
A. Stress causes your stomachaches?
B. Stress causes different problems with different people.
A. So what did he tell you to do?
B. He said I need to think positive.
A. He didn't give you any medication?
B. I hate medication. It makes me feel different.
A. So how do you think positive?
B. I think about nice things.
A. Like what?
B. Like a day at the beach, with my toes in the sand.

A. I cut my finger.
B. How did you do that?
A. It's a paper cut.
B. Paper can be dangerous.
A. It hurts, too.
B. Paper cuts can hurt a lot.
A. Where are the band-aids?
B. I think they're in the medicine cabinet.
A. It's on the tip of my finger.
B. A band-aid might not work.
A. I must not use this finger until the cut heals.
B. It might take a day or two to heal.

A. Do you smell that?
B. Oh, yes.
A. I can't stand cigarette smoke.
B. It smells so bad.
A. One cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.
B. Smokers think they are so cool.
A. They are so weak.
B. A little cigarette controls them.
A. They look so stupid taking a puff.
B. And then they blow smoke out of their mouth.
A. They think it's cool.
B. Cigarettes stink.

A. Do you have a cold?
B. Yes, I do.
A. How did you get it?
B. My sister had a cold. She gave it to me.
A. Have you taken anything for your cold?
B. No, I just blow my nose a lot.
A. Your nose is stopped up?
B. Yes. I have to breathe through my mouth.
A. Have you tried nose drops?
B. No, I don't like nose drops.
A. They work great.
B. I don't care. I don't like to put drops in my nose.

A. Would you put suntan lotion on my back, please?
B. Sure.
A. Thank you.
B. You shouldn't lie in the sun for too long.
A. I want to get a tan. I don't want to look so pale.
B. What's wrong with looking pale?
A. People think you might be sick.
B. Who thinks that?
A. I don't know.
B. It's better to be pale than to have skin cancer.
A. I know that.
B. So why are you arguing with me? Don't lie in the sun too long!

A. I can't quit smoking.
B. Of course you can.
A. I don't have enough will power.
B. Of course you do.
A. I wish I had never started.
B. So does every smoker.
A. I've tried to quit so many times.
B. So has everyone else.
A. Nothing seems to work.
B. All it takes is will power, and you have it.
A. Then why can't I quit?
B. You have to believe in yourself.

A. My back is killing me.
B. What did you do?
A. I got out of my car.
B. That's it?
A. I injured my back one time just by sneezing.
B. You should see a doctor.
A. My doctor said I need surgery.
B. So?
A. So, forget it.
B. You don't have the money?
A. I have no insurance.
B. Maybe a back rub would help.

A. My brother smokes three packs a day.
B. Three packs of what?
A. Cigarettes, of course.
B. How can he do that?
A. When he is almost finished with one cigarette, he uses it to light another.
B. He's a chain smoker.
A. He's been a chain smoker for 30 years.
B. That's unbelievable. Can he still breathe?
A. He can, but the people around him can't.
B. How can he still be alive?
A. His doctor says his heart and lungs are strong and healthy.
B. Maybe I should start smoking.

A. I hate brushing my teeth.
B. It's such a chore.
A. Brush, brush. Spit, spit.
B. What did they do in the old days?
A. They brushed with their fingers.
B. They also ate with their fingers!
A. Why do they call it the good old days?
B. Maybe because they didn't have to brush and floss.
A. Who invented flossing?
B. A dentist, I'm sure.
A. I hate flossing more than brushing!
B. I can't wait till all my teeth fall out.

A. Let's stop for a while. I need a break and some water.
B. This trail is hard to climb.
A. Especially on a hot day like this.
B. I can't believe we haven't seen any animals.
A. Thank goodness! I don't want to see any wild animals.
B. All we've seen so far is a couple of lizards.
A. We're hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears.
B. I bet I've lost a couple of pounds already.
A. All you've lost is some sweat.
B. I haven't even lost one pound of fat?
A. If you want to lose fat, you've got to do this hike every day.
B. Okay, but let's hike in town. At least there are cats and dogs to see.

A. Oh no, another pimple on my face.
B. Pimples suck.
A. It seems like I get a new pimple almost every day.
B. Maybe it's something in your diet.
A. No, I eat the same things day after day.
B. Then maybe it's in your genes.
A. You might be right.
B. Do pimples run in your family?
A. Not that I've noticed.
B. Well, maybe it's from the pollution in the air.
A. Whatever the cause, I hate seeing them on my face.
B. Well, on the bright side, they're fun to pop.

A. Do you believe everything you hear?
B. I don't believe anything I don't see with my own eyes.
A. You can't believe what you hear on TV or radio.
B. You can't believe what you read in the newspapers.
A. Everyone tells you a different story about the same thing.
B. Three different people will give you three different stories.
A. And the government will give you a fourth story.
B. Yes, like the government says not to worry about the swine flu.
A. But the swine flu just killed 20 people in Mexico.
B. The government says we have nothing to worry about.
A. Then why are some schools telling the kids to stay home?
B. The government says to wash our hands frequently, and we'll all be okay.

A. Don't pick your nose.
B. I wasn't picking my nose.
A. What were you doing?
B. I was scratching my nose.
A. I think I know the difference between picking and scratching.
B. Okay, mom, maybe I was picking it a little bit.
A. Use a tissue next time.
B. I didn't have a tissue.
A. Then wait till you find a tissue.
B. I couldn't wait. It was an emergency.
A. Oh, really? Maybe you should have called 911.
B. It wasn't that kind of emergency.

A. Our TV remote is filthy.
B. Yes, it's covered with crud.
A. I'm going to clean it.
B. Don't use water on it!
A. I'll use a damp cloth.
B. Don't let water get into any of the cracks.
A. I'll squeeze the cloth so it's almost dry.
B. Don't rub the numbers off the remote.
A. I will rub gently but firmly.
B. Do it quickly, please, so I can change channels during commercials.
A. I'll give it back to you in a couple of minutes.
B. Maybe we should put it in a plastic bag to keep it clean.

A. My ear is killing me.
B. What's the matter?
A. I was on a plane.
B. So?
A. So, every time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt.
B. That's no good.
A. Sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn't.
B. Have you seen a doctor?
A. I've been to two doctors.
B. And they couldn't fix your problem?
A. They both said I have to live with it.
B. Or you can stay off planes.

A. Did you see the woman with the new face?
B. Did she get a nice job?
A. She got an "everything" job!
B. What do you mean?
A. A team of doctors gave her a whole new face.
B. Why did they do that?
A. A mad dog bit most of her face off.
B. Oh, that's terrible. What does she look like now?
A. Her face is really fat, but they say the swelling will go down.
B. And then will she look normal again?
A. I guess so.
B. God bless modern medicine.

A. There's something wrong with my right hand.
B. What's wrong with it?
A. It aches most of the time.
B. What do you think it is?
A. I don't know. I think it's old age.
B. If it's old age, why don't both of your hands hurt?
A. That's a good question. Maybe it's not old age.
B. Are you right-handed?
A. Yes. All my life.
B. You're wearing out your right hand. Stop using it so much.
A. But I do all my writing with my right hand.
B. Start typing instead. That way your left hand will do half the work.

A. I'm Jenny.
B. I'm Jason. Nice to meet you!
A. Nice to meet you too!

A. Hi, Jason. What department are you in?
B. Hi, Jenny. I'm in the chemistry department. How about you?
A. I'm a psychology major.

A. Hi, Debbie. How are you?
B. Not too bad, Jim. And yourself?
A. Pretty good, thanks. Did you have a good weekend?
B. Yeah, it was great. I caught up on some sleep and some work.

A. Hi, Debbie. How are you?
B. Not too bad, Jim. And yourself?
A. Pretty good, thanks. Did you have a good weekend?
B. Yeah, it was great. I went out with some friends.

A. What day is it today?
B. Wednesday.
A. Almost over the hump!

A. How many credits do you have this semester?
B. 32.
A. 32!? Are you crazy?
B. A little, I guess. How about you?
A. 28.
B. Oh, that sounds so much more manageable.

A. So what should we do for lunch today?
B. We don't have much time. Let's just go to the student center cafeteria.
A. OK. I like that one anyway – they have lots of veggies.
B. And it's on our way to the Gongtong Building.

A. Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!
B. Happy Moon Festival!
A. But no moon cakes for me this time. Too fattening.
B. But the pomelos are delicious.

A. I'm sorry I won't be able to make it to class next Monday.
    I have to attend my grandmother's funeral in Gaoxiong.
B. I'm so sorry to hear this news. Make sure you get the assignments from a classmate.
A. I will, thank you.  

A. So what are you doing on our day off?
B. I think I'll sleep, then I'll get up to eat, then I'll do nothing for a while,
    and then maybe I'll take a nap. How about you?
A. Nothing I could come up with could top that.

A. OK, now tell me all about all the sleeping and eating you did on our day off.
B. Some vacation! I was at the pc doing homework almost the whole time!
A. I'm not saying a thing about those 32 credits.
B. Smart decision.

B. So what did you do?
A. I took a bus out to Sanxia and shopped on the Old Street there.
B. What'd you get?
A. A pretty camphor wood carving for the wall.
B. We should go out there together sometime.
A. Yeah, that would be fun.

A. Do you have time for coffee?
B. Sure, but I'd better stick with juice or tea, or I'll be up all night.
A. Caffeine doesn't seem to affect me that much...
    A small latte, hot, please, for here.
B. One small mango smoothie, please, for here. Here's my NTU ID.
A. And here's mine.

A. Are you keeping up with everything OK?
B. I was pretty frazzled the first two weeks of the semester.
A. But now?
B. I'm almost caught up in all my classes.
    Being busy sure forces you to find ways to be more efficient.

A. I'm tired of cafeteria food. Let's do something different tonight.
B. Have anything particular in mind?
A. There's a place on Dingzhou Road that has good steam-fried chive rolls.
B. But they don't have any place to sit.
A. We can bring them back to the Student Center to eat.
B. OK. Let's go.

A. There's always a ridiculously long line for the red bean cakes.
B. I know – it's weird. I tried them once, and couldn't for the life of me
    figure out what was so special about them.
A. We're lucky they don't all like the chive rolls instead. No waiting!
B. Ten chive rolls, please.
C. Here you are. Be careful – they're hot! ... That'll be 130 NT dollars.
B. Thanks! ...
A. I'm stuffed! Those things are really filling!

A. Just now I thought someone had brought their little kid with them here.
B. Why?
A. I heard this really high, tiny, sweet voice.
    Then I turned to have a look at her, and saw that she was about 19 years old.
B. I wonder if she talks like that on purpose, or if it's just her natural voice.


A. What's that song they're playing? I love it!
B. I have no idea. But it is nice. Wonder what it is and who the singer is.
A. I'll jot down a couple lines of the lyrics and Google it.
B. That usually works.

A. We visited my uncle's family and my grandma in New Taipei City this weekend.
B. How was it?
A. It was nice. My uncle cooked for us and we all caught up on each other.
B. It's good to spend time with family. I wish my grandparents lived closer.

B. How's your grandma doing?
A. She forgets things very quickly. She asks us the same questions over and over.
B. Do you find that frustrating, or tiring?
A. No. We just have the same conversation again
    as though it were the first time.
    We don't know how much longer she'll be with us,
    so I try to make the best of every minute with her.

B. I can't find my bike.
A. Think back – where did you last park it?
B. Right here. But it's not here.
A. What does that message written in chalk on the asphalt say?
B. "Illegally parked bicycles towed to Shuiyuan campus 11/19."

B. Really, there was no other place to park. Every slot in the rack was already taken.
A. Is this the first time your bike's been impounded?
B. Uh, second. But I don't think they start charging till the third offense.
A. But going to reclaim your bike is such a hassle.
B. Hey, what the heck – let's have some Mexican food while we're in the area.
A. And then maybe go on a riverside walk.

A. I'll sing soprano, you sing alto, Eugene will sing tenor, and Jason, bass.
B. When do we rehearse, and where?
A. How about near the pond by the law building, if the weather's nice,
    at 6:30 tomorrow evening, right after supper?
B. OK, but if the weather's not nice?
A. We'll figure something out.

A. We all need to start learning our parts and memorizing the lyrics, today!
B. What if we're not sure about some of the pronunciations?
A. What else? Use the audio and YouTube files! And Merriam-Webster!

B. Very impressive – you got the only 100% in the whole class!
A. Well, I did study pretty hard for this calc test.
B. You know, I have tickets to the Elton John concert next week, and...
A. You have tickets to the Elton John concert?!

B. Yes, two. I really didn't want to go alone...
A. And...?
B. Well, would you like to go to the concert with me?
A. ... (catches her breath) Wow, yes! ... Thanks for asking me!
B. Maybe we can get a bite to eat before it starts. I'll email you the details.
A. Great! ... Well, I have class now. Talk to you later!
B. See ya.

A. I can't find anything to wear!
    Everything in my closet and drawers is short-sleeved and it's freezing out!
B. Maybe it's time to get your winter clothes out.
A. Mm, yeah...I guess it is... If only I had the time...

B. Looks like you'd better make time, don't you think?
A. Guess I don't have much choice. I can't go out in a tank top in this weather.
B. I'll help you get the boxes out of storage.
A. Thanks. That'll be a good start.

B. What are you doing up at this time of night?
A. How about if you answer the same question first?
B. Uh, well, I really tried to finish my lab report early this time.
    But somehow I kept remembering other urgent things that needed to get done.
A. So now you're going to pull an all-nighter?
B. Looks like it.
A. Join the club.

B. I can't concentrate any more. I need a break. And fuel!
    Would you like to meet somewhere for a quick snack?
A. I'd love to, but my work has finally started to flow,
    and I don't want to break the momentum.
B. Guess I'll have to go alone then.
A. I have some cheese rolls, and some dried squid that a family friend gave us.
    Oh, and some cut Asian pear.
    Would you like to stop by and pick them up?
    No chatting though – work has to come first this time!
B. OK, thanks, I'll be right over, and I promise not to stay too long!


A. The switch on this LED lamp I bought online is broken – I can't turn it off.
B. Is there a number you can call?
A. I'll have a look...Oh, here's a number, and a one-year warranty.
    But it's in simplified characters!
B. Well, call the number and see what they say...
    Well? What'd they say?
A. They said to mail it to them.
    At first they said I'd have to pay NT$250 for repairs.
    But I've only had it for five months!

B. So did you mention the one-year warranty?
A. Yes, but they said that warranty is only for the PRC,
    and that the warranty in Taiwan is only for three months.
B. Did you argue with them?
A. Yes. I said that was the only warranty included with the lamp.
    And I asked them if they give better service to their PRC customers
    than their Taiwan ones.
B. What'd he say then?
A. He very begrudgingly said, "OK, we'll fix it. Send it over."
    So I did. But what lousy service!

A. Hey look, that's Angela!
B. Who's Angela?
A. A student in our department from about four years ago.
    She's on TV! She looks great! She's singing one of my favorite songs of hers!
B. So you knew her personally?
A. Yes, a little – we had some friends in common.
    She was a top student, but sort of quiet.
    She was in France for a year as an exchange student.
B. Then when she returned to Taiwan
    she suddenly burst onto the scene as a singer?

A. No, not suddenly. For a while she was translating movie subtitles.
B. Kind of a dead-end job?
A. Yes, she got really tired of it. She couldn't see any future in it.
    It didn't pay all that well either,
    and the "we need it yesterday" deadlines were killing her.
B. So then?
A. She started writing her own songs, and performing them in pubs,
    accompanying herself on the guitar.
    Later she added some more instrumentalists.
B. She has a nice voice. And the lyrics are really thoughtful.
A. She's just put out her second CD. I can get you one if you want.
B. That would be great!
    I'll show it off to everybody and tell them
    I know somebody who knows somebody famous!

A. Make sure you log out before leaving. This is a public computer.
B. Doesn't it always log out by itself after a while?
A. Some programs do, but others don't.
    Yesterday I opened gmail on this same computer,
    and a friend's inbox was right there in front of my eyes, open on the page.
B. So what did you do? Did you peek at a few of their emails?

A. I sure was tempted. I only saw the list of senders.
B. And then?
A. Well, actually, I did have a quick look at one email...
B. Haha! Snoop!...What did you see?
A. Nothing very exciting at all. But I felt pretty lousy about it.
B. So...
A. So then I logged out for the friend and checked my own mail.
B. And you made sure to log out before you left?
A. I most certainly did.

A. (on phone) Are you OK? You don't sound too good.
B. I don't FEEL good. I haven't been sick for ages,
    but now I have a full-blown cold.
    I'm coughing and sneezing all over the place,
    and my ears are plugged up.
A. Are you taking anything for it?
B. No, just lots and lots of rest, and warm water.
A. Is there anything I can do for you?
B. Yes, as a matter of fact. Could you please finish all my work for me?
A. I...uh...
B. Oh, that's OK, I'll just hand everything in late.

A. Traffic is moving so slowly in this lane.
B. Look over there – that's why.
A. Yikes! A motorcyclist is lying on the side of the road next to his bike!
B. And a big van has pulled over on the other side of the road.
A. I hope someone has called for help...
B. I'm guessing the van driver has – he's probably OK.
A. An ambulance should be coming up soon then.
B. No ambulance yet...
     but look at that big, yellow, flower-covered hearse going by!
A. That can't have anything to do with the accident!
     But what a creepy coincidence! Whooh! Gives me the shivers!

A.  Where's the 7-Eleven?
    There used to be one here, but it's gone now.
B. Let's look around. We could go above ground...
A. I don't want to go that far out of our way.
B. What is it you want?
A. An iBon machine so I can get a High Speed Rail ticket for tomorrow.
B. You know, we could just go over to the HSR vending machines,
    and you'd save the NT$30 handling fee besides.
    We ARE in Taipei Main Station you know...
A. Oh...yeah, we are, aren't we...

A.  Taipei to Taichung is NT$1400 round trip.
    I've got two one-thousand-NT-dollar bills here...
B. Wait a minute – let's read the instructions first.
    It says "Change given only in coins."
A. So that means I'll end up with NT$600 in heavy coins if I get the tickets here?
B. Uh, how about if we ask at the information desk for change?
A. OK... (to C) Excuse me, could you change a NT$1000 bill?
    I need some hundreds for the machine.
C. We don't give change, but there's a bill changer right over there you can use.
A. (to C) Thank you!
    (to B) And thank you, Jason – first for saving me NT$30,
    then for lightening my stash of 50-NT coins by NT$600!

B.  Gifts of food are great, but what are you going to do with all those very ripe bananas?
A. Make some banana cake – what else? Wanna help?
B. Sure. What should I do?
A. Get the whole wheat flour, salt, an egg, and milk from the fridge.
B. OK ... here you go.
A. We have some fresh blueberries –
     let's add those in, and some chopped pecans, and coconut.
B. Yum! I'll peel and mash the bananas. ...
     Ugh! Fruit flies!

A. I'll take care of the wet ingredients –
    I'll beat the egg, and stir in the oil, milk, honey, vanilla, and mashed banana.
B. Then I guess I'll measure and mix the dry ingredients –
     the flour, salt, baking powder and cinnamon.
A. OK, time to put them together. The nuts and blueberries go in last.
     Be careful not to crush the blueberries!
B. I've oiled the pan. How long should it bake?
A. About 40 minutes, I guess. ... (time passes)
     (sniffs the air deeply) Smells good! It should be done by now...
B. A bit more than done, I'd say, as in, "just a tiny bit scorched."
     But that's OK – we can just trim off the edges and bottom...

A. My hair is getting too long.
    But I'm not that satisfied with my current hairdresser.
B. So, let's find you a new one. How about that shop?
A. OK, what the heck...
    ...Hi, how much is a wash and cut?
C. NT$499. Would you like to request a particular stylist?
A. No, it's my first time here. Anybody who's really good is fine!
D. Just lie back and relax. Is the level of pressure about right?
A. Yes, it's fine. And I'd like conditioner, please.
D. Sure...I'm going to start the second lathering now...
    ...Would you like some Q-tips?...
E. ...How'd you like it cut?
A. I'd like my bangs and the back trimmed,
    and I'd like the rest thinned out a bit and layered.
E. Where would you like the part?
A. On the left, right about here.
E. ...(hands A a mirror) Here, have a look. What do you think?
A. (takes a breath)...It's fine. Here's NT$1000.
E. It's NT$30 extra for the rinse. Here's your change and receipt.
    Thank you, and please come again!...
B. (outside)...So, how do you like it?
A. It could have been worse. But you'll notice that I didn't ask her for her card...
B. (looks at A's hair) Hmm, yeah...
    Mm, maybe you can try that place over there next time...

A. I'm tired.
B. What's with you? You didn't sleep well last night?
A. Mm, no, not really.
B. Cramming for an exam? Wanted to finish a movie? Too much coffee?
A. None of the above. I was unable to shut out expressions of tenderness
    between my roomie and her new BF...
B. Ah, when did that start?
A. Exactly two days ago. They were Skyping till after 3am!
B. Didn't you ask her to save it till daytime?
A. Yeah I did, so then she started using a headset –
    but that didn't do much to shut out the giggles...

A. Wow, you look sharp today!
C. Uh, thanks. Must be the new shirt...
A. Yeah, you have really good taste!
C. My girlfriend's the one with the good taste –
    she picked it out for me!
A. Actually, I don't think it's just the shirt –
    you look really happy!
C. Oh, yeah. I did OK on one of my mid-terms.
A. For which subject?
C. French. I even got a compliment from the professor.
    Made my day!

A. Happy birthday, Jason! (hands him a wrapped gift) I hope you like it!
B. (Taking the package) Wow! I didn't think anybody would remember!
     This is so sweet of you!
     (opens gift) Wow! A calculator! Just what I needed – my old one is broken!
     Thanks so much! I love it!

A. Do you have time this evening?
     I'd like to take you out to a new restaurant I've discovered.
B. I'm overwhelmed! Sure. When and where should we meet?
A. At the Xinsheng side gate at 6pm. See you then!
B. OK, see you then.

A. I'm leaving for San Francisco this coming Tuesday.
    Would you be available to take me to the airport?
B. What time is your flight?
A. It leaves at 11:40pm.
B. Ah, a red-eye! Sure, no problem!
     I'll pick you up at your place around 8.
A. Thanks so much! This really helps me out a lot!

B.  Which terminal does your flight leave from?
A.  It's EVA Air, so Terminal 2.
B.  I'll miss you...
A.  We can stay in touch over Skype!

B.  Where's the closest bathroom in this building, do you know?
C.  Yes, it's at the end of the hall on the right.
B.  Thanks. ... (coming back quickly from men's room) ...
      Uh, could you spare a tissue or two?
      They're out of paper! Or maybe they're just cheap.
C.  Probably the latter. Here you are.
B.  Thanks! (rushes into stall)

B.  (coming out of men's room)
      You were a Boy Scout, weren't you.
C.  Actually, no, I wasn't.
     I wasn't that crazy about knot-tying. 
     Why do you ask?
B.  Looks like you follow their motto better than I do:
     "Be prepared."
C. This is something everybody should prepare for,
     not just former Boy Scouts, don't you think?

C. (on cell phone) Hi, Jason, I just saw that it's 9am...and I just woke up....
B. (on break) Weren't you the one who's always prepared?
C. Uh, not this time. I was up till 3am finishing a report last night.
    The alarm didn't go off and I overslept.
    Could you please tell Professor Mei I'm really sorry,
    and I'll get to class as soon as I can?
B. Sure. But is it even worth coming? Class finishes at 10.
C. I'm going to try. I feel terrible about this!
    This is so out of character for me!

B.  Professor Mei, Rob just called to say
     he's sorry that he overslept and missed first hour.
     He's on his way now.
D. This is pretty out of character for Rob –
     he's always on time with everything.
B. That's what he said.
     He says he was up late finishing a report.
D. Thanks for letting me know...OK, everybody – back to work!

B.  You look like Rudolph! How'd your nose get so red?
A.  I went river tracing this past weekend in Hualian.
B.  Wow! I've heard about it but never tried it. How was it?
A.  I had a blast! You definitely should try it soon!
B.  OK, so tell me about it!
A.  First you put on a body suit, a life jacket, boots, and a helmet.
     Then you walk over rocks upstream against the current
     with a horde of people.
     You have to work hard to keep your balance and keep moving forward.
    
B.   You say that was "fun"?
A.   Yes! When you're upstream you dive into the river from a high rock,
      or let yourself down with a rope. It wasn't as scary as it looked.
B.   How do you get back?
A.   You just lie back and float and the current takes you back,
       like a human raft!
       But you have to watch out so your butt doesn't get hit by rocks.
B.    I'll have to try it sometime! I'm not about to be outdone by a girl...

A.    Is it just me or are we having an...
B.    It's an earthquake! Hang on tight!
A.    You too!
B.    Wow, this is a long one...
A.    ...I guess that's it...for now...

B.    Nothing came crashing to the floor.
A.    Every time an earthquake hits, my first thought is to wonder
       if it's going to be another 9/21.
B.    Me too. We've been lucky so far.
       Wonder how everything is in the rest of the island.
A.    Hope everybody's OK.
B.    Haha – it's fun watching all the "Earthquake!" posts popping up on Facebook!

A. It's an ugly day today.
B. I know. I think it may rain.
A. It's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today.
B. That would be weird.
A. Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.
B. I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.
A. Yes, it would be. 
B. I really wish it wasn't so hot every day. 
A. Me too. I can't wait until winter.
B. I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.
A. I'd rather be cold than hot.
B. Me too.

A. It doesn't look very nice outside today.
B. You're right. I think it's going to rain later.
A. In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.
B. That wouldn't seem right.
A. Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.
B. Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. It's too hot.
A. I know, you're absolutely right.
B. I wish it would cool off one day.
A. That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon.
B. I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.
A. I know what you mean, but I'd rather be cold than hot.
B. That's exactly how I feel.

A. I wish it was a nicer day today.
B. That is true. I hope it doesn't rain.
A. It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
B. It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
A. It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.
B. Any rain right now would be pointless.
A. That's right, it really would be.
B. I want it to cool down some.
A. I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter.
B. Winter is great. I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.
A. I would rather deal with the winter than the summer.
B. I feel the same way.

A. It's such a nice day.
B. Yes, it is.
A. It looks like it may rain soon.
B. Yes, and I hope that it does.
A. Why is that?
B. I really love how rain clears the air.
A. Me too. It always smells so fresh after it rains.
B. Yes, but I love the night air after it rains.
A. Really? Why is it?
B. Because you can see the stars perfectly.
A. I really hope it rains today.
B. Yeah, me too.

A. Isn't it a nice day?
B. It really is.
A. It seems that it may rain today.
B. Hopefully it will.
A. How come?
B. I like how clear the sky gets after it rains.
A. I feel the same way. It smells so good after it rains.
B. I especially love the night air when it rains.
A. Really? Why?
B. The stars look so much closer after it rains.
A. I really want it to rain today.
B. Yeah, so do I.

A. Don't you think it's nice out?
B. Yes, I think so too.
A. I think that it's going to rain.
B. I hope that it does rain.
A. You like the rain?
B. The sky looks so clean after it rains. I love it.
A. I understand. Rain does make it smell cleaner.
B. I love most how it is at night after it rains.
A. How come?
B. You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains.
A. I would love for it to rain today.
B. I would too.

A. I really want to go to the beach this weekend.
B. That sounds like fun. What's the weather going to be like?
A. I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.
B. Is it going to be perfect beach weather?
A. I believe so.
B. Good. I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.
A. I know. I really want to go to the beach.

A. I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.

B. This California weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll 
happen.
A. I know. Every day the weather seems different.
B. I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.
A. That would make it easier for us to make plans.
B. I know. Things are easier when you know what the weather's going to be like.

A. I've enjoyed conversing with you.
B. Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast?

B. I wasn't done talking to you.
A. I have to do some things, and besides, it's not polite to be nosey.
B. I'm not being nosey. I'm just asking.
A. I really don't think it's any of your business.
B. That's not nice.
A. I apologize, but I'm getting off the phone now.
B. Okay.

A. I'll talk to you later.
B. What's the rush?
A. I have to get off the phone now.
B. I'm not ready to get off the phone with you.
A. There are other things I need to take care of.
B. What is it that you need to do? 
A. Please don't be nosey.
B. I'm not being nosey, it's just a question.
A. You don't need to worry about that.
B. That was mean to say.
A. I am very sorry, but I must go.
B. I guess.

A. Well, it was nice talking to you.
B. It was nice talking to you too.
A. We should really hang out again.
B. That would be fun.

B. I've been going here for a couple years now. You?
A. This is my first year.
B. How do you like it so far?
A. It's all right.
B. You don't like it?
A. I'll like it better once I finish my GE.
B. That's exactly how I used to feel.

A. How are things with you?
B. Not too bad. How about yourself?
A. Not bad.
B. I'm glad to hear that.
A. Have you been going to PCC long?
B. I've only been here two years. How about yourself?
A. I just started this year.
B. Do you like it?
A. It's fine for right now.
B. You do not like it, right?
A. Once I'm finished with my GE, it should get better.

A. How is everything going with you? 
B. Great. You?
A. Pretty good.
B. Good for you.
A. When did you start going to PCC?
B. This is my second year. How about you?

A. Could you help me?
B. What do you need?
A. I can't seem to find my class.
B. What building is it in?
A. It's in the C building.
B. Oh, I know exactly where that is.
A. Do you think you can tell me where it is?
B. Sure, what room number is it?
A. It's room number 261.
B. I have a class around there right now.
A. Could you show me where it is?
B. No problem, come on.

A. Excuse me, I need your assistance.
B. Sure, what's up?
A. I have no idea where my class is.
B. Tell me which building it's in.
A. My class is in the C building.
B. I know where the C building is.
A. Do you mind telling me where it is?
B. Of course, which room number is it?
A. Number 261.
B. I actually have a class right around there.
A. Can you please show me?
B. I can do that.

A. Do you mind helping me?
B. What can I help you with?
A. I'm not sure how to find my next class.
B. Do you know what building that it's in?
A. The C building, I think.
B. Well, that's not far away.
A. Could you point me in that direction?
B. Do you know what the room number is?
A. It's C261.
B. My next class is around there.
A. Can you show it to me?
B. Sure, let's go.

A. How do I buy my textbooks?
B. Do you have your book list for your class?
A. Yes, I have my list.
B. Fine. Once you have it, you can go to the bookstore. Do you know where that 
is?
A. Yes, I know where the bookstore is.
B. OK, so once you pass the gym, it's the first door on your left. Do you know 
you can also sell your used textbooks there? 
A. No, I didn't know I could do that.
B. You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just 
outside the door. Do you think you will be doing that today?
A. Yes, I am going today.
B. Well, if you decide to go, I could meet you over there at 1:00 today or 
tomorrow to help you. Would that work for you?
A. Yes, thank you. That would be great.
B. Well, then, I'll talk to you later. Have a good day!

A. Where can I buy textbooks?
B. First, you need to have the list of books for your class. Do you have that?
A. Yes, I have that.
B. Well, when you have that, you can take it over to the bookstore. Can you find 
it?
A. No, I don't know where the bookstore is.
B. Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left. Were you aware that 
you can also turn in your old textbooks for money?
A. Really? How can I do that?
B. Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near 
the entrance. He will pay you for them. Are you going today?
A. No, I can't make it today.
B. I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1:00 today or 
tomorrow. Would you like my help?
A. No, thanks. I'm good.
B. I'll see you later then. Have a great day!

A. Can you help me buy my textbooks?
B. There will probably be a book list in the bookstore. Do you have your class 
schedule handy?
A. No, I don't have that.
B. To get started, take that list over to the bookstore. Do you know where the 
bookstore is?
A. I am not sure where the bookstore is.
B. When you pass the gym, it'll be the first door on the left. Do you know how 
to sell your old textbooks for money?
A. Yes, I knew I could do that. Exactly how do I go about selling them?
B. If you give your used textbooks to the person at the booth outside the door, 
he will reimburse you. Can you go over there today?
A. I think maybe I could be there.
B. I am free at 1:00 today or tomorrow if you need some help. Want to meet me 
over there?
A. Maybe that would work.
B. I'll catch you later then. Have a wonderful morning.

A. Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr. Miller?
B. Yes. Are you going to be taking a class from him?
A. Yes, but I have never taken his class before.
B. He is very interesting and challenging. Is that what you are looking for?
A. Yes, that's what I need.
B. He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade. Are you 
willing to study hard?
A. Yes, I guess so.
B. What I really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly 
teacher. Do you enjoy that in a teacher?
A. Yes, I had a teacher like that before.
B. Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience?
A. No, I didn't, but that could be a good thing.
B. Well, take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you. Good 
luck!

A. Do you know anything about Dr. Miller's classes?
B. Yes. Are you in his class?
A. I'm thinking of taking his class next semester.
B. He really knew his stuff, but he graded hard. Would that be OK?
A. Yes, I really need someone who is really good.
B. I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it. Can you 
do that?
A. Maybe, but I'm not sure.
B. Man, this guy was so funny when he was teaching. I like that, don't you?
A. No, that stuff isn't important to me.
B. Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field?
A. I don't care about any of that.
B. We all are looking for different things in an instructor. I hope I've helped 
you.

A. Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr. Miller's classes?
B. Yes. Have you ever been in one of his classes?
A. I'm thinking about taking his class next semester.
B. He was a very easy teacher. Are you thinking of taking a class with him?
A. I'm not sure because I really need to learn something, but I also worry about 
grades.
B. Grades are important, but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is 
important, too?
A. I really need to learn this stuff.
B. He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by. Do you know 
what I mean?
A. Yes, that sounds right for me.
B. Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military?
A. Yeah, I already knew that. That could be a good thing.
B. I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you. Enjoy your 
year!

A. Professor, could I make an appointment with you?
B. I am free tomorrow afternoon between two and four; do you have a particular 
time in mind? 
A. Two o'clock would be the best time.
B. Fine, do you know where my office is?
A. No, I'm not sure.
B. Remember, it is in the E building on the third floor.
A. I see.
B. Don't worry, it will work out fine once you get there. I'll see you then.
A. I'll see you then.
B. Looking forward to meeting with you!

A. Excuse me, Professor, is there a time when I could meet with you?
B. I could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four; what time works 
out best?
A. I would like to come in at three o'clock.
B. I am glad that that works out; can you find my office?
A. Yes, I can.
B. Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the 
third floor.
A. I got it.
B. If you do get lost, just ask someone in the building to point the way.
A. Thank you, I'll be there.
B. If you need to cancel your appointment, please give me a call!

A. Professor, do you have a few moments when I could meet with you?
B. I schedule my appointments from two to four on Saturday; what works best for 
you? 
A. Three would be a good time.
B. Great, do you need directions to my office?
A. I'm not sure.
B. Well, just make sure to go through the double doors, and I'll be on the 
right.
A. OK, I'll find it.
B. It's very easy to find.
A. See you then.
B. I will enjoy seeing you; have a good week!

A. Excuse me, Professor. I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done.
B. What happened that you didn't get it done?
A. I had to watch a football game instead.
B. Well, you had more than one day; couldn't you have fit it in on another day?
A. Yes, I think so.
B. Either way, I only allow one missed assignment per semester. When will you be turning the make-up in?
A. I'll make it up next week.
B. Fine, but it cannot happen again if you want an “A” in the class.
A. OK, I can do that.
B. Remember that you are in college now, not high school.

A. I don't have my homework today.
B. You usually are good about turning it in; what happened?
A. I was really sick.
B. But couldn't you have done it when you felt better?
A. Yes, I probably could.
B. You have already missed one other assignment; when can I expect the make-ups?
A. Next class meeting.
B. That will be soon enough, but make sure you get next week's assignment in as 
well, all right?
A. That would work for me.
B. Good. I know that you are capable of being an excellent student.

A. Let me tell you what happened to my homework.
B. OK, go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time?
A. Actually, I did it, but then it got lost.
B. Could you have gotten it done at another time?
A. Yes, I could.
B. You have never missed an assignment before--when will you be making this one 
up?
A. I'll make it up early next week.
B. That would work, but don't let it happen again.
A. I'll try.
B. That will solve it then. Let's work hard to not let it happen again.

A. Excuse me, Professor. I think there might be an error in my test score.
B. Sure. Do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked 
wrong that should have been marked right?
A. I think that the percentage is incorrect.
B. Let's just go over all of it to double-check.
A. Sure, let's do it.
B. Here is the answer sheet. Do you see a place where I marked something wrong 
that should have been right?
A. I don't see any mistakes.
B. OK, now that we've gotten those straightened out, let's total the score.
A. Yes, let's total it.
B. Well, if I total that like this and divide by this number, I get this total. 
Do you agree?
A. Yes, you're right.
B. Well then, we are all straight. Have a good day and thanks for bringing that 
to my attention.

A. I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher.
B. Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked?
A. I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right.
B. These things can happen; let's double-check the answers first to be sure, all 
right?
A. That would be great!
B. Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers. Do you see any place 
where I made a mistake in grading?
A. This one right here should be right.
B. Yeah, I see the same thing; now we can do the math and check that, right?
A. Yeah, let's do the math.
B. I count all of the correct answers, total them, and divide by the total. Does 
this look right to you?
A. Looks pretty good.
B. Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores; keep studying!

A. Could we go over some things, because I think my test score is wrong.
B. What do you think is wrong, the math or the way your answer was scored?
A. Both.
B. I am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes, too. Will 
that work for you?
A. Yeah, I'm ready.
B. Check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where 
you see the mistake.
A. These look strange.
B. Yes, I agree; let's move on to the calculating of the score. Would that be 
OK?
A. OK, let's do the calculation.
B. We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage.
A. I see.
B. Anytime you have a question, please feel free to ask!

A. Do you have the notes from last week's class?
B. Did you come late?
A. I couldn't make it.
B. Why is that?
A. I was sick.
B. Oh, okay. Well, here you go.
A. Are these all of them?
B. Oh, wait, here are the rest.
A. Thanks a bunch.
B. Don't mention it.

A. Do you mind if I borrow the notes from last week?
B. Were you here last week?
A. I was unable to make it.
B. How come?
A. I was sick that day, and couldn't make it.
B. Well, here are the notes.
A. Are there any more?
B. Sorry, here you go.
A. Thanks a lot.
B. No problem.

A. Let me get last week's notes.
B. Yeah, sure--you didn't come to class that day?
A. I couldn't come.
B. Why not?
A. I wasn't feeling well.
B. Here they are.
A. Thanks a lot; are these all the notes?
B. Oh, no, this is the rest.
A. Thank you very much.
B. It's no problem at all.

A. I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades.
B. Grades are based on many things: homework, attendance, quizzes, mid-term, and 
final.
A. What counts the most?
B. Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation.
A. Do you grade on a curve or use percentages?
B. Homework, attendance, and quizzes are sixty percent; the mid-term and final 
are worth twenty percent each.
A. What if we miss something?
B. I will allow one unexcused absence; after that you need to contact me ahead 
of time.
A. Will you tell us if we are failing during the year?
B. You will be able to track your progress during the year.

A. What do you base our grades on?
B. All of your coursework is important, including everything from attendance and 
homework to all of your test results for the semester.
A. Does the final count the most?
B. All of it is important; please just do your best at all times.
A. How do you total our scores?
B. The final and mid-term are twenty percent each; homework, attendance, and 
quizzes are the rest.
A. What if we are out sick?
B. Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence.
A. How can we know if we are doing OK during the year?
B. Your grade will not be a surprise; you will know what you need to work on.

A. How do you decide what grade we get?
B. I look at many things: attendance, quizzes, and tests.
A. What is the most important factor?
B. Obviously I look for improvement as we go along, but I would like you to do 
your best from the beginning.
A. How can we keep track of our grades?
B. The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade; homework, attendance, and 
quizzes total 60 percent.
A. What if we can't get to school?
B. You can only miss one class without penalty.
A. If we have a major problem, will you let us know?
B. I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem. 
A. I'd like to talk to you about my grades.
B. Sure! What exactly do you have questions about?
A. I am worried that I messed up on a test.
B. Well, let me take a look at my grade book. How do YOU think you are doing?
A. I think I am doing great, except for that one test!
B. Well, your scores show that you could do a little better. What do you think 
you could improve on?
A. I think that I could study a little harder for tests.
B. Fine! Please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to 
begin.
A. Yes, I know.
B. I'm sure you'll do fine.

A. Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades?
B. Step into my office for a moment. What is your concern?
A. Am I failing?
B. Let's go on the computer to see what's up. Do you think you are doing well?
A. I am pretty sure that I am in trouble.
B. I can see that you are trying, but where do you think you could improve?
A. I missed a few classes; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular 
basis.
B. Having a regular study routine and following it is very important, right?
A. I'll try; it's hard!
B. Thanks for stopping by!

A. Professor, I'm concerned about my grades. Do you have a minute?
B. Of course, how can I help you?
A. I want to know if I am doing OK.
B. Let's pull out your scores so far. Do you think you are doing OK?
A. I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well.
B. I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas, but not so well in others.
A. I think I could take better notes and read a little more.

improve on.
A. I'm working on it!

B. Well, have a good day off from class.

A. Professor, I will not be here for our next class meeting.

A. I tried to work something out, but I really do have to miss one class.
B. Will you be able to make up the work you missed?
A. I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading.
B. Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester.
A. Yes, I remember.
B. Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder?
A. Sure, no problem.
B. Make good use of that day off; you'll only have one this semester!

A. I have to miss school next week.
B. Isn't there some way you could work your schedule out to be here?
A. Unfortunately, this is what I have to do.
B. How are you going to catch up?
A. I've got it all covered.
B. If you miss this class, you will have used up your quota for the semester.
A. Don't worry, this will be the last class I miss.
B. Make sure to remind me right before you are absent.
A. I'll remember.
B. Enjoy your day off and don't forget to study!

A. Professor, I am going to need to leave class early today.
B. What is the problem?
A. I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative.
B. Are you planning on having someone take notes for you?
A. Yes, I've got that part covered.
B. When, exactly do you need to leave?
A. I don't need to leave until the very end of class.
B. Fine, but next time try and not have to miss class again.
A. Thanks, Professor. See you later!
B. See you later! Drive carefully.

A. Excuse me, Professor, I have a problem and need to leave class early.

B. OK, but please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed.
A. Thanks, Professor. I've got it covered!
B. Go do what you have to do, but make sure it doesn't happen again.

A. I am sorry, but I can't stay until the end of class.
B. Where do you need to be that is more important than school?
A. I have an appointment.
B. Do you have a plan to make up your missed work?
A. No, but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work.
B. Are you going to go right away?
A. I am leaving right now.
B. All right, but please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up.
A. Thanks, Professor. I'll make sure everything gets taken care of.
B. Goodbye, and try not to miss any more school.

A. I have an appointment for 1:30.
B. What can I help you with?
A. Well, I have a problem with my class schedule.
B. What is it?
A. It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time.
B. I can understand the problem with that.
A. Is there any way that you can fix my schedule?
B. No problem, do you want those classes still?
A. Yes, I do.
B. Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day.
A. Thank you very much. 

A. I'm here for my appointment.
B. What can I do for you today?
A. I have an issue with my schedule.
B. Tell me the problem.
A. I have two classes on here that are at the same time.
B. Oh, I see.
A. Can you change that for me?
B. Do you still want both classes?
A. Yes, I would like to keep both classes.
B. I'll try to change one to a different day.
A. I would greatly appreciate that.

A. I was supposed to meet with you at 1:30.
B. Yes, I see. What did you need to see me about?
A. There's a problem with my schedule.
B. What's the problem?
A. Two of my classes occur at the same time.
B. Well, I can see that's a problem.
A. Is it at all possible for you to fix that error?
B. Yes, I can. Would you still like to have both of these classes?
A. I want to keep both of them, if that's possible.
B. Well, let me find you one of these classes on a different day.
A. Thanks a lot.

A. I am unsure how to add a class and need help.
B. I have an opening. Do you have an add sheet for me to sign?
A. Yes, I have an add sheet.
B. After I sign it, you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add 
the class. Do you know where that is?
A. No, I'm not sure.
B. When you cross the quad, the office is right in front of you. Go inside and 
follow the signs to the correct line.
A. Thanks. I understand what to do now.
B. It should be easy to find. After you add the class, check with me in a few 
weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet.
A. That sounds good.
B. Good, just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a 
class. Good luck!

A. Professor, can you help me add your class?
B. You have to bring me an add sheet to sign. Do you have one?
A. No, I will have to get an add sheet.
B. You must take the signed add slip to the Admissions and Records Office to add 
the class. Do you know where that is?
A. No, I don't know where that is.
B. The office is in front of you as you cross the quad. The signs in the hallway 
will tell you where you need to be.
A. I think I can find it.
B. You'll find it easily. Make sure you add the class and then we will look at 
the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on.
A. Thank you for letting me add your class.
B. To drop a class, you need to do the same thing with a drop slip. Good luck!

A. I am not sure how to add a class.
B. Do you have an add sheet for me to sign? 
A. I'll bring one next time.
B. When you get the signed add slip, you must take it to the Admissions and 
Records Office or you will not be added. Can you find the office?
A. I think I know where it is.
B. Across the courtyard on the right is the office. Follow the signs to the 
correct line. Is that clear?
A. Thank you for your directions. It's clear.
B. You can't miss it. Add the class and then come back. We'll check later to 
make sure you are on the roll sheet.
A. That's great. Thank you so much.
B. Do the same thing with a drop slip if you ever need to drop a class. Good 
luck!

A. When are we leaving for our field trip?
B. Our science field trip is next Monday at 8:00 in the morning. Can you mark 
that on your calendar?
A. Yes, I will write that down.
B. That will be Monday, December 2nd. We need to start loading the buses half an 
hour early, so plan to arrive at 7:30.
A. Yes, I will be there on time.
B. We will return 6 days later on December 8th. Will someone be picking you up?
A. Yes, someone is coming to get me.
B. The return bus will leave the campground at 5:00 p.m. and return to campus 3 
hours later at 8:00 p.m.
A. What should we bring with us?
B. I am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page. 
Check it out when you get a chance. See you Monday!

A. Can you tell me what the date and time of our field trip is?
B. We are leaving on our science field trip at 8:00 a.m. next Monday. Do you 
have something to write that down on?
A. Yes, I can write that on my calendar.
B. That will be on the second of December. Be there ½ an hour early to get your 
bags on the bus. Do you understand?
A. Yes, I understand.
B. The bus will bring you back 6 days later on December 8th. Is someone coming 
to get you?
A. No, I don't have a ride yet.
B. We will be leaving the campground at 5:00 in the evening and arrive at our 
campus at 8:00 p.m. Any more questions?
A. How much will the trip cost?
B. I put all of that information in the packet. I'll give you another copy if 
you need one. See you on Monday!

A. What date will our field trip be on?
B. The science field trip is next Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning. Do you 
want to make note of that on your calendar?
A. Yes, I will make note of that.
B. Next Monday is December 2nd. The buses will leave at 8, but we must begin 
loading at 7:30. 
A. Be there half an hour early.
B. You might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on 
December 8th. Do you have a ride?
A. Yes, someone is picking me up.
B. To get back to campus by 8:00 p.m., we will be leaving the campsite at 5:00 
p.m. Do you have any more questions?
A. Not at the moment—maybe later, though.
B. All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the 
hallway. See you on Monday!

A. Hi, could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch?
B. Sure! What kind of food would you like?
A. I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian, maybe.
B. I know the perfect place!
A. Good! Where is it?
B. It's right past that last building on the left. Do you want me to go with you?
A. That would be great.
B. Glad you asked me to join you. This will be fun!

A. Man, I'm hungry. Do you know a good place to have lunch?
B. Yes, I know a great place. What types of food do you like?
A. Mexican, Japanese or Chinese would be great.
B. Oh, I know a place where you might like to eat.
A. Is it close by?
B. It's down a block on the right; can I show you the way?
A. OK, I'd love the company.
B. This will work out well. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

A. Let's have some lunch; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere?
B. I'm hungry, too. What types of food sound good?
A. Maybe just a quick sandwich, salad, or something.
B. I have a great idea of where you might like to go.
A. Can we walk there?
B. It's on the second floor. May I join you?
A. Of course! Let's go.
B. Let's hurry. I'm starving!

A. Can you help me figure out how to use this machine?
B. Yes, I would be happy to help. What do you want to buy?
A. I want to buy that candy.
B. OK. So this machine will make change if you need it. Do you have your dollars 
ready?
A. Yeah, so far, so good.
B. Next, you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot. Make sure they are 
smooth.
A. Yeah, I already knew that.
B. I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck, you might have to re-feed 
it.
A. OK, let's move on!
B. Now you just make your selection and pray. If nothing comes out, try again or 
call the number on the side of the machine.
A. I hope it works!
B. Well, good luck!

A. I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help.
B. Sure, no problem. What are you trying to get?
A. I want to buy a drink.
B. OK. This machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct 
change. 
A. I've got the correct change already.
B. First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot. The dollars 
have to be smooth.
A. OK, what next?
B. Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and 
you have to try again.
A. OK, next? 
B. Choose what you want and push the button. Sometimes it takes a couple of 
tries.
A. I agree with you.
B. Hope that works for you!

A. I want to know how to buy something from this machine.
B. Yeah, the new ones can be tricky. What are you trying to buy?
A. I want to buy one of those snack things.
B. Are you ready to go?
A. I'm clear so far.
B. The money goes in the slot over there. It has to be smooth to go in.
A. It won't go in!
B. Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to 
get it to work.
A. Yes, next step.
B. Make your selection and hope for the best. Vending machines aren't all that 
reliable.
A. They're totally unreliable.
B. You seem to have it down. Have a good day!

A. Excuse me. I am interested in getting a library card.
B. Sure, let me give you an application. You can fill it out right here at the counter.
A. OK, here it is.
B. Let me take a look at this for you. May I have your driver's license, please?
A. Here's my license and form. 
B. You seem to have filled the form out all right. Are you familiar with our rules and fines?
A. Yes, I know what to do.
B. The hours and limitations are printed on the card and this handout.
A. OK, I see.
B. Thank you for joining the library; we look forward to serving you.

A. I was wondering if you could help me to get a library card.
B. Of course, just fill out this form and let me know when you are finished.
A. I'm finished.
B. I will also need your driver's license; hand me the filled-out form, please.
A. OK, the form is all filled out.
B. Perfect! Do you know the hours and rules for the library?
A. No, I have no idea what they are.
B. Everything you need to know is printed on the card and handout.
A. Yes, right.
B. Great! You are all set to enjoy the library.

A. Good morning. Is this where I can get a library card issued to me?
B. No problem, we have a short form right here; just hand it to me when you are 
done.
A. I'm done.
B. That looks great, but I will also need your driver's license or other form of 
I.D.
A. Sure, here it all is.
B. Well, this looks nice. Do you know how to use it?
A. I am pretty sure how to use it, but can you remind me?
B. Of course, just remember that all of the needed information is on the card.
A. I see.
B. Well, I hope you have a wonderful time on your library visits!

A. Can you help me with returning my late books?
B. This is the right spot to pay your fee. Put your books down right here.
A. OK, here they are.
B. I can see that you owe 25 cents a day. That will be one dollar and fifty 
cents total.
A. OK, here's the money.
B. We are interested in getting our books back; so as long as all the fines are 
paid off by the end of the semester, you will be fine. Does that make sense?
A. I'm not sure.
B. Your registration and transcripts can be held up if there is an outstanding 
fine.
A. Now I understand.
B. Well, you can always keep your late fees down by using the night drop if we 
are closed. Enjoy the library!

A. These books should have been turned in last week.
B. You have come to the correct place. Hand me your books.
A. Here they are.
B. Whoa, these are pretty late! You owe five dollars total to clear your fine.
A. I don't have the money right now.
B. We only require that all fines must be paid off by the end of the semester. 
So you will be okay to go.
A. What would happen if I didn't pay it?
B. It's really important to always clear your fines, so you'll get a report card 
and transcripts on time.
A. Yeah, but I don't know how they can do that.
B. Always remember that the night drop is here, and we really appreciate you 
returning your books for all to use.

A. My library books are late, where can I put them?
B. This is where they need to be turned in. Let me see them to check the date, 
OK?
A. Yeah, I think that they are really late!
B. Not all that late. You only owe the library fifty cents.
A. What if I can't pay it?
B. We appreciate you paying off all fines as soon as possible, but always before 
the end of the semester.
A. Yeah, I get it.
B. Your report card and transcripts will be held until you pay all fines, so 
always make sure that you do that.
A. That's not really fair!
B. If we aren't here, always feel free to use the night drop outside. Thanks for 
coming in!

A. Excuse me, could you help me figure out how to use this new parking meter?
B. Sure, it was confusing for me also. Have you ever used a regular meter?
A. Yes, I understood the old one.
B. Well, on this one you can use coins or a debit or credit card; which one would you like to use?
A. Debit or credit card.
B. OK. Now, do you see what the rate is on the sticker?
A. Yes.
B. OK, now that we know what it will cost, put the money or card into the machine.
A. Yes, I can do that.
B. Wonderful; now, this machine asks you the number of your spot, so put that in also.
A. Yes, I'm ready.
B. All you have to do now is take your receipt and put it on your dashboard.

A. Whoa, I never saw a meter like this before; how do you use it?
B. It's simple, once you do it a few times. Do you know how the old one worked?
A. I never used a parking meter before.
B. So we start out by deciding whether you will use cash or a credit or debit 
card.
A. Cash.
B. Fine, can you read the rate on the display?
A. Yes, I can.
B. Fine. Now that we know what they are ripping us off for, insert the payment.
A. I'd rather not pay, but I have to.
B. Fine, this machine does not ask you the number of your spot, so we can move 
on, all right?
A. Perfect, let's do it.
B. Now just check the meter to see how many minutes you have.

A. This parking meter is really confusing. Can you help me figure it out?
B. It's just like the old one, but with new stuff added.
A. Yeah, OK.
B. The first step is deciding on debit or credit card payment, so which one is 
it?
A. I have coins.
B. Perfect. Now, can you see the rate on the sign?
A. I didn't see that, but now I do.
B. Once you know what it will cost, put the payment in.
A. Here it goes!
B. You are doing great! Let's move on to the next step.
A. I am a little confused.
B. Just make sure that everything registered, and then you are good to go!

A. I'd like to purchase a parking permit for next semester.
B. Are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings?
A. I am a daytime student.
B. Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car?
A. I will be driving my car.
B. OK, that will be twenty-five dollars. How would you like to pay for it?
A. I'll pay for it with a check.
B. Would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle?
A. No, thanks; I'm fine.
B. Here you go then. Have a great school year!

A. I'll need a parking permit for next semester.
B. Do you attend school during the day or only at night?
A. I only attend class part-time in the evenings.
B. Do you drive a motorcycle or an automobile? 
A. I have both, but I usually use my car to get to school.
B. Great, the price for that permit is thirty dollars; cash, check, or credit card?
A. I'll pay cash.
B. Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle?
A. No, thank you.
B. OK, here is your permit; enjoy the new semester.

A. I want to buy a parking permit, please.
B. Are you a full-time student or do you attend part-time in the evenings?
A. I attend both day and evening classes.
B. Will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car?
A. I ride a motorcycle.
B. That permit will run twenty-five dollars; will that be cash or credit card?
A. I'll use a credit card, thank you.
B. Do you need a second permit for a car?
A. No, just the motorcycle permit.
B. Fine, here it is and have a great semester!

A. Can you tell me where I can park? 
B. Are you driving a motorcycle or an automobile?
A. I drive an automobile.
B. Fine. You can either park in the student lot or on the street. Do you know 
what a handicapped space is?
A. Yes, I have seen those spots.
B. Well, when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo, do not park 
there unless you have a special permit. Are you going to be parking in the 
daytime or evening?
A. I park in the evenings.
B. Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs. Have 
you seen those signs?
A. Yes, I have seen those signs.
B. The signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days. Do 
you know how to read the curb colors?
A. Yes, I know what the curb colors mean.
B. Well, just as long as you realize that red means no parking and white means 
loading and unloading, I think you know what you need to know.

A. Where should I park?
B. Do you have a car or motorbike?
A. I drive a scooter
B. In that case, you can park either in a student lot or on the street. Are you 
aware of the marked handicapped spots?
A. No, I haven't seen those spots.
B. The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless 
you have a handicapped permit. Will you mostly be parking during the day or 
night?
A. I park in the daytime. 
B. Make sure you pay special attention to the street signs with time limits. 
Have you noticed those signs?
A. No, I have not seen the signs.
B. Pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what 
days you can park there. Do you know what the curb colors mean?
A. No, I don't know what the curb colors mean.
B. Just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading 
and unloading only. I think you'll be good to go!

A. What is the best place to park?
B. What vehicle do you usually bring to school? Is it an automobile or a 
motorbike?
A. I drive a motorcycle.
B. OK. That means you can park in the student lot or on the street. Have you 
seen the handicapped spots?
A. I am not sure what a handicapped spot is.
B. Look for the blue signs and blue marked spaces. Do you usually park in the 
daytime or the evening?
A. I park days and evenings.
B. Be careful about the time limits on the streets. Have you seen the signs for 
time limits?
A. What signs?
B. As long as you are careful reading the signs, you will always know how long 
you can park and what days are OK to park there. Are you aware of the curb 
colors?
A. What curb colors?
B. If you can remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that 
you can only load and unload, you are going to be OK.

A. Hey, I got this parking ticket; can you help me figure a way out of it?
B. First of all, did you park somewhere too long or in the wrong spot?
A. I was there too long.
B. Was the area clearly labeled with the time limit and all?
A. Yeah, I saw it.
B. You will need to convince the judge that you couldn't see the signs.
A. Yeah, I understand.
B. Whatever you do, you need to be respectful and polite to the judge.
A. Yeah, you're right.
B. Just try to talk to him about how IF you made a mistake that it won't happen again.
A. OK, I will.
B. Good luck!

A. Man, I got another parking ticket. I am so unlucky--what can I do?
B. Was your car where it wasn't supposed to be, or did you stay there too long?
A. I was in an area where I wasn't supposed to park.
B. Could you tell where you were supposed to park and for how long?
A. I could tell what I was supposed to do.
B. That's too bad. That means that you can't use receipts or a witness to help 
you out. 
A. I guess not.
B. Try brown-nosing the judge, but don't be too obvious about it.
A. Sure, if it will help.
B. Try and convince him that something was labeled wrong or something.
A. Sounds good!
B. Give it your best shot; it might work.

A. I don't know how to fight a parking ticket.
B. Did you get written up for exceeding the time limit or for parking where you 
weren't supposed to be?
A. Both.
B. Did you see all the signs and just decide to blow them off?
A. I was confused.
B. Maybe you could explain that you are new and got confused--could you do that?
A. If it might work, I'll go for it!
B. Let the judge see that you are only a poor starving student who won't do it 
again.
A. I can see how that might work.
B. Without actually saying that the parking ticket guy was an idiot, make it 
seem as though it was HIS mistake, not yours!
A. I could do that!
B. Try it. It just might save you the price of a parking ticket.

A. What can I help you with today?
B. I need to check out this book.
A. Do you have your library card?
B. I don't have one.

A. We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house.
B. Oh good! Can I bring anything?
A. We will be providing hot dogs, hamburgers, and cake, but people can bring 
side dishes.
B. I am assuming that the dress is casual.
A. Dress casually and bring your bathing suit!
B. Wonderful. Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there.

A. Robert, do you have plans for the weekend?
B. I have nothing definite planned.
A. Saturday is Mary's birthday, and we are throwing her a party.
B. Sure, I could come to her party. Where are you going to have it?
A. It's going to be a pool party at Jay's apartment building. 
B. That sounds like fun. Is it a potluck?
A. We would like for people to help us by bringing side dishes and drinks.
B. The dress will be casual then?
A. Make sure to bring your bathing suit, and dress casually.
B. Sounds great. Just drop me an e-mail with the time you've picked.

A. Robert, are you going to be in town this weekend?
B. I don't have anything scheduled yet.
A. We were wondering if you would like to come to Mary's birthday party on 
Saturday.
B. I would enjoy coming to Mary's party. Will it be at your house?
A. The party will be at Jay's house out by the pool.
B. Will everyone be pitching in with some food?
A. It would be great if you could bring a side dish, but the rest of the food 
will be provided.
B. What should we wear?
A. This is a pool party, so make sure to bring your bathing suit.

drop me an e-mail.

A. Mr. Lee, I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for 
next Friday night?
B. Yes, I think we might be free. What did you have in mind?
A. I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner 
party at my home.
B. That sounds great. Is it casual?
A. Actually, we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the 
holidays.
B. That sounds good. It will give my wife a chance to dress up.
A. Yes, we've invited four other couples, so it should be a good mix of people.
B. That sounds wonderful. Will there be anyone there that I know?
A. Oh yes, everyone we are inviting is from our company.
B. Great! I'll look forward to it. We'll make sure and check the mail for our 
invitation.

A. Mr. Lee, would you and your wife be free next Friday night?
B. I don't think we have any plans, but I would need to see what my wife has 
planned. Why?
A. My wife mailed a written invitation to your wife asking you both to our 
dinner party.
B. It would be our pleasure to join you for dinner. What type of party is it?
A. We've always wanted to have a formal dinner party.
B. I think we would enjoy that, especially our wives!

conversation.

company?
A. Yes, you will know all of our guests.
B. I'll make sure to check the mail for our invitation. Your dinner plans sound 
wonderful.

A. Would you and your wife be available next Friday night, Mr. 
Lee?
B. I'll have to check with my wife, of course. Did you have something planned?
A. We are having a dinner party, and my wife sent you and your wife an 
invitation.
B. I think we would enjoy that. Is it a formal affair?
A. My wife insisted on having it be a formal dinner party this time.
B. That would be a change. Usually we just do barbeques and never get a chance 
to dress up.
A. We thought that inviting four other couples would make nice conversation.
B. I think we will enjoy being there. Will we know anyone?
A. We are only inviting people from work.
B. I am sure that a good time will be had by everyone. We will be looking for 
your invitation.

the party?

B. I am glad you are free. Do you know how to get to my house?
A. If you would e-mail me your address, that would help.
B. Sure, no problem. Can you think of anyone else I can invite to the party?
A. My friend Jake is in town, and I would like it if I could bring him.
B. Sure, bring Jake along. The more the merrier!
A. Can I bring anything?
B. If there is something special that you and Jake would like to drink, bring 
that along.

party on Friday night?
A. A party would be a perfect way to end the week!
B. Good! Do you need my address?
A. I've been to your house once, but I would appreciate you e-mailing me your 
address.
B. That would be no trouble at all. Who else do you think I should ask to the 
party?
A. I don't know if you remember my friend Jake, but I would like to bring him 
with me.
B. Jake would be welcome. If you think of anyone else, feel free to bring them 
along also.
A. What would you like me to bring?
B. Everything is taken care of, but if you and Jake want to bring something to 
drink, that would be appreciated.

favorite groups?

B. Yeah, Malia would be able to help us choose a concert.
A. Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now.
B. Good! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift.

A. I can't figure out what to get Mary for her birthday.
B. I am having a problem figuring that out myself. Do you want to pick something 
out together?
A. Yes, that way we would have more money to spend.
B. She has a lot of interests. What things do you think she likes to do the 
best?
A. Well, she really likes going hiking, listening to music, and travel.
B. The music idea sounds good. I wonder who knows what concerts she might like 
to go to?
A. Maybe we could ask her roommate, Malia, who her favorite groups are.
B. Malia would be a great help. She has known Mary a long time.
A. Let's e-mail Malia and ask her for her suggestions.
B. I think that maybe Malia might like to contribute to this gift too.

A. I have been trying hard to pick out a cool gift for Mary for 
her birthday.
B. That's been challenging for me too. Would you like to go in with me and 
choose something together?
A. Yes, two heads are better than one.
B. What does she like to do? That might help us pick something out.

concert she might like to go to?

thinks.

together.

B. I'm good, Tad. How are things with you?
A. Things couldn't be better right now.
B. Boy, that's quite a spread over on the food table! Let's go check out the 
party food.
A. Julie, who is the woman sitting next to Lee on the sofa?
B. Someone told me her name is Mary. Supposedly, she and Lee are living together 
in Lee's apartment.
A. What about his relationship with Malia?
B. Malia is no longer in the picture. She moved to Australia to be with a guy 
she met on vacation.
A. How did Lee feel about that happening?
B. He took it pretty well. I think that he had kind of had his eye on Mary for a 
while.

A. Their wedding was absolutely beautiful.
B. It really was. I want a wedding like that.
A. How much do you think they spent on their wedding?
B. I think it might've cost them a nice chunk of change.
A. Do you want a big wedding like that?
B. Not really. I'd rather have a small wedding.
A. I wouldn't want a small wedding.
B. Why not?
A. I want my wedding to be big and memorable.
B. It can be small and memorable too.
A. Well, to each his own.
B. You are absolutely right.

A. Their wedding was just exquisite.
B. I know. Maybe one day I'll have a wedding like that.
A. What do you think their budget was?
B. It must have cost them a pretty penny.
A. Would you like to have a big wedding like they did?
B. No. I think I would prefer a smaller wedding.
A. I want a big wedding.
B. How come?
A. I want my wedding to be extravagant, and I want everyone to remember it.
B. Your wedding doesn't have to be big to be memorable.
A. Whatever floats your boat.
B. That is correct.

A. Their wedding was so beautiful.
B. I agree completely. I hope that I have a wedding like that one day.
A. How much do you reckon it cost to pull that wedding off?
B. I think it cost them a lot of money.
A. Do you hope to have a wedding as big as theirs?
B. I don't think so. I want to have a smaller wedding.
A. Not me.
B. Why do you want a bigger wedding?
A. I want to have a large wedding that everyone will remember.
B. You can have a small wedding, and people will still remember it.
A. Whatever flicks your Bic.
B. That is true.

A. Do you want to go to the beach tonight?
B. Sure, which beach are we going to?
A. I wanted to go to Malibu beach.
B. I like Santa Monica.
A. The water there looks so dirty.
B. I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica.
A. I like the pier too, because it's beautiful at night.
B. Is Malibu beach nice?
A. It's a lot nicer, and I really like it better.
B. So you want to go to Malibu?
A. If that's okay with you.
B. Sure, let's go to Malibu.

A. What do you think about going to the beach tonight?
B. I'd love to. Which beach?
A. It's up to you, but I was thinking Malibu beach.
B. I really like Santa Monica beach.
A. But the water there doesn't look too clean.
B. I only go because of the pier.
A. The pier is really nice at night.
B. How is it at Malibu beach?
A. I love Malibu beach, because it's so beautiful.
B. So is Malibu where you really want to go?
A. Are you cool with that?
B. Yeah, we can go to Malibu.

A. I want to go to the beach tonight.
B. That sounds like fun. Which one are you thinking about?
A. I was thinking Malibu, unless there is another beach you want to go to.
B. How about Santa Monica?
A. I don't really like that beach, as the water seems really dirty.
B. The only thing I like about that beach is the pier.
A. At night, the pier is absolutely beautiful.
B. What's it like at Malibu beach?
A. I love that beach, because it's just so nice.
B. So we're going to Malibu?
A. Well, if you don't want to go to Malibu, we can go to Santa Monica.
B. We can always go to Santa Monica another day.

A. Do you enjoy going on dates?
B. Yes. I find dates to be a lot of fun.
A. What's so fun about them?
B. They give me the opportunity to get to know someone better.
A. So you always have fun on dates?
B. Not always. I don't always like the person I'm on the date with.
A. Why not?
B. My date may not be my type.
A. So then why would you ask them out in the first place?
B. I didn't realize until after our date that they weren't my type.
A. Sounds like a huge waste of time to me.
B. Now that I think about it, it really is sometimes.

A. Do you like dating?
B. It's really a lot of fun.
A. What makes it so much fun?
B. It makes it easier to get to know somebody.
A. Are dates always fun to you?
B. Sometimes I may not like the person I'm having a date with.
A. Why is that?
B. The other person isn't always my type.
A. Why would you bother going out with them then?
B. I didn't know that they weren't my type until after I got to know them better.
A. It seems to me that you're wasting your time.
B. You are absolutely correct, sometimes it is a waste.

A. Are dates fun for you?
B. I enjoy dating a lot.
A. Why are they so fun for you?
B. Dates allow me to meet new people.
A. Your dates are always fun?
B. Well, I don't always like who I'm dating; so not always.
A. How come?
B. The person I am dating may not be my type.
A. How come you asked them out if they weren't your type?
B. You don't always know what type of person you go on a date with until you know them well enough.
A. Dating sounds pointless.
B. Now that you mention it, sometimes you're right.

A. Can I ask you a question?
B. Sure, what's up?
A. Well, I was just wondering if you'd like to go out this Friday.
B. Really?
A. Yeah, I was thinking we could get a bite to eat and catch a movie.
B. That sounds like fun.
A. Of course, we can do something else if you'd like.
B. No, no, dinner and a movie sounds great.
A. Well, what time would you like me to pick you up?
B. How about 7:30?
A. That sounds good, so I'll see you then.
B. Okay, cool.

A. May I ask you a quick question?
B. Of course.
A. How would you like to go on a date with me this Friday?
B. Seriously?
A. Well, I figured that we could go see a movie and get some dinner.
B. Cool, that sounds like it will be fun.
A. We can always do something else if you'd rather.
B. Not at all. I would love to go to dinner and a movie.
A. That's great, so what time do you want me to come get you?
B. Is 7:30 okay?
A. Friday at 7:30 sounds perfect.
B. Great. See you then.

A. Can I ask you something?
B. Sure you can. What's going on?
A. Would you go out with me on Friday?
B. Are you for real?
A. I thought that we could go to dinner and a movie.
B. That actually sounds like it would be a lot of fun.
A. Unless there's something else you would prefer to do.
B. Actually, I would really like to go to dinner and a movie.
A. What time do you want me to come by and pick you up?
B. Is 7:30 cool with you?
A. That's perfect, so I'll see you then.
B. Perfect. I will see you on Friday.

A. Hi, Todd, how is it going?
B. Things are going well. How are you, Mary?
A. I've also been doing well.
B. You know I've been thinking about maybe taking in a movie this weekend. Do 
you like to go to the movies?
A. Yes, I really enjoy movies.
B. Well, I've been hoping that we could spend some time together away from here. 
I was wondering if you would like to go out Friday evening for dinner and a 
movie.
A. Sure, that sounds good.
B. Is there any movie in particular that you might be interested in?
A. I was thinking about that movie, "Australia."
B. Yeah, that looks like one that we both might enjoy. If I picked you up at 
7:00, would that work out OK for you?
A. Seven o'clock would be great!
B. Fine, then I'll see you at 7:00. I am looking forward to a great evening!

A. Hey Todd, how are you?
B. I've been doing well. How are things with you, Mary?
A. Things are good with me also.
B. Mary, I was looking in the paper at the new movies coming out. Do you enjoy 
movies?
A. Yes, I go all the time.
B. I was hoping that you and I could maybe spend a Friday evening together. I 
was wondering if you would like to go with me this Friday to see a movie and get 
a bite to eat afterwards.
A. I would love to go out with you on Friday.
B. Do you have a certain movie that you would like to see?
A. I've heard a lot of things about the movie "Australia."
B. You know, I was thinking that that would be a good movie to go see together. 
Would 7:00 be a good time to pick you up?
A. Seven o'clock would be perfect!
B. OK, I'll pick you up at 7:00 then.

A. Todd, how have you been?
B. Everything is good. How have you been, Mary?
A. Perfect, couldn't be better.
B. Mary, I was thinking that I might go to the movies this weekend. Do you go to 
the movies very often?
A. Yes, I like going to the movies.
B. Would you be interested in letting me take you to the movies on Friday? Maybe 
we could get a bite to eat afterwards.
A. I think I would enjoy seeing a movie with you on Friday.
B. I am not sure what movies are out right now. Have you heard of any that you 
might be interested in?
A. I think that that new movie, "Australia," looks like it might be good.
B. That movie sounded interesting to me too. If I picked you up at 7:00, would 
that be too early?
A. I think that seven o'clock will work out well.
B. Perfect! Well, I'll see you at 7:00 on Friday, then!

A. Hi, are you Mia?
B. I am Mia. You must be Rubin.
A. Yes, that's me!
B. It's so good to finally meet you. Karen has told me so much about you!
A. I hope that she had good things to say about me!
B. She had only good things to say. Did you have trouble finding me?
A. Well, how many beautiful women in a red dress by the fountain are there?
B. Thank you for the compliment!
A. So would you like to go get a bite to eat, Mia?
B. That sounds perfect. Lead the way!

A. Hi, is your name Mia?
B. Yes, my name is Mia. Are you Rubin?
A. Yes, I am Rubin!
B. Finally! The infamous Rubin! I've heard so much about you that I feel like I 
already know you.
A. Oh no, I hope they had positive things to say.
B. Don't worry. All of the stories were good. How were you able to find me so 
quickly?
A. It was pretty easy to find the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the 
fountain.
B. Well, I guess that kind of narrowed it down!
A. Mia, could I interest you in some lunch down the street at my favorite cafe?
B. Yes, it's a great day for a little walk and some lunch.

A. Hi, I am looking for a woman named Mia.
B. I think I am who you are looking for. You have got to be Rubin, then.
A. That would be me!
B. Rubin! Karen and Mike have spoken about you so often that I feel like I've 
met you before.
A. I hope that what they had to say was mostly good!
B. They only said wonderful things about you. You did a good job of finding me.
A. Finding the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the fountain wasn't all 
that hard.
B. Yes, I guess it was a choice of me or the pigeons!
A. I was hoping that we could take a walk down the street to my favorite cafe.
B. Lunch sounds great! Let's head on out!

A. Hi Linda, this is Todd.
B. Todd, good to hear from you!
A. I just wanted to tell you what a great time I had with you at the movies last 
week.
B. Me too, Todd! Thanks for suggesting that great movie.
A. I also enjoyed it and was wondering if you would like to go for a hike in the 
mountains with me on Saturday.
B. I would love to join you on a hike. Could I maybe bring a picnic lunch for us 
to eat on the trail?
A. Sure Linda, that's a great suggestion.
B. Fine then, what time are we going to leave?
A. I was thinking maybe 9:00 or so, so that we could get started before the heat 
gets too bad.
B. Nine would be perfect. I'll see you then!

A. Linda, this is Todd calling.
B. Todd, I am so happy you called!
A. Linda, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed our time together last Friday 
night.
B. Boy, Todd, that was one great movie you picked out! Thanks for asking me to 
go with you!
A. I had a great time too and was thinking that maybe you might want to join me 
for a hike to the waterfalls on Saturday.
B. A hike would be great! Let me pack us a nice picnic lunch, OK?
A. Linda, that would be a perfect addition.
B. I'll take care of the lunch then, and you can take care of the other plans. 
What time would you like to pick me up?
A. I was hoping to leave by 9:00 so that it won't be too hot for the hike.
B. Nine is a great time to get started. I'll see you on Saturday!

A. Oh hi, Linda, this is Todd.
B. Yes, Todd, how nice to hear your voice!
A. Linda, I just wanted to say that I had a wonderful evening with you last 
Friday.
B. I really enjoyed our evening together, Todd.
A. I had fun also and was wondering if you would like to go hiking with me in 
the mountains on Saturday.
B. Hiking would be perfect! May I bring along a picnic lunch for us to share?
A. A picnic lunch would be a nice thing to have along.
B. I'll work on the lunch, and you can work out the details of where we will go. 
What time will you be at my house?
A. Nine would be good, don't you think?
B. Nine is good. See you on Saturday!

A. John, I was talking to the travel agent about where we might 
be taking our vacation this year.
B. I am going fishing in Alaska with my friend, Mark.
A. What are you talking about?
B. What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation?
A. You and I have been together for a whole year, and our vacation time should 
be about the two of us!
B. Really? Who made that rule up?
A. With that attitude, I don't really think we have much more to discuss here.
B. That works for me!

A. John, I was looking through some magazines for ideas about 
where we might go on vacation this year.
B. I've already told my buddy, Mark, that I am going hunting with him in Alaska.
A. You can't be serious!
B. Hey, I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation. I am sorry that bothers 
you.
A. After a year together, I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would 
automatically spend our vacation together.
B. Says who? I don't think that is necessarily the case.
A. You know, now that I think about it, I really don't have much more to say to 
you at all!
B. Whatever you say!

A. Brian and Christina were mentioning that maybe it would be 
fun to go on vacation together this year, John.
B. I thought that I already told you that I am going with Mark to Alaska.
A. Are you kidding me?
B. You know what? You and I had no plans, so I made plans with Mark. What's the 
problem?
A. We have been together for a year and usually, people who've been together a 
year, take their vacation together.
B. I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before. Any more rules that you 
would like to tell me about?
A. Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back, why don't you just move 
in with him as well!
B. I am really looking forward to getting away from you. Far away from you!

A. Joe, how are you doing?
B. I am great! How about you, Mary? How are you?
A. I am doing great! Thank you for asking, Joe.
B. I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight?
A. I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper.
B. OK. What about going to the movies on Friday night?
A. What were you planning on seeing?
B. I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer.
A. How about “The Secret Life of Bees”?
B. That's a chick flick!

A. Hi Joe, how are you doing today?
B. Things are going good today. How have you been doing, Mary?
A. Things are going well for me, Joe.
B. Want to go see a movie tonight?
A. My parents are taking me to dinner tonight.
B. Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night, instead?
A. What movie did you want to see?
B. There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer.
A. I was thinking that I would like to see “The Secret Life of Bees.”
B. Oh great! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to!

A. Hey Joe, how have you been?
B. I am doing well. How about you, Mary?
A. I am doing OK, Joe. 
B. There is a new movie at the mall that I want to see. Want to go with me?
A. I can't because I already promised my roommate that I would go shopping with 
her.
B. I could go to the movies on Friday night instead. Would that be better?
A. Did you have a certain movie in mind?
B. I thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims 
would be a good choice.
A. I kind of wanted to see “The Secret Life of Bees.”
B. Maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror 
movie!

A. Hi Kara, it's Mike here.
B. Hi Mike, how are you doing?
A. I'm doing well, and you?
B. Everything is going great. 
A. Kara, would you be interested in going to dinner again this Friday?
B. Mike, I had a good time too, but I am getting ready to move back to the east 
coast, so I think I shouldn't get too involved right now.
A. Well, we could just go out as friends.
B. Right now, I think I need to really focus on matters at home, but thanks for 
a nice evening.

A. Hi Kara, this is Mike
B. Hello Mike. How are things going for you?
A. Great, how are you?
B. Fine. Everything is just fine.
A. Kara, I had a great time the other night and was wondering if you would like 
to go out again this weekend.
B. Mike, I enjoyed your company, but I am getting ready to graduate soon. I 
really need to focus on my studies.
A. Maybe I could help you with what you need to get done.
B. It would be better for me to just deal with getting my work done, but thank 
you for a lovely dinner.

A. Hello, this is Mike, Kara.
B. Mike! Good to hear from you. How are you?
A. Everything is fine, and how are you?
B. Things are going well with me.
A. Kara, I had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would 
like to go out again this Friday.
B. Mike, I don't think that it's a good idea to go out again. I really need to 
focus on getting packed and ready to move back home.
A. Maybe we could just meet for coffee or something.
B. I can't really deal with any distractions right now, but I appreciate the 
nice evening we spent together.

A. Hi, can I speak with the apartment manager, please?

A. Could I speak to the apartment manager?
B. I am the apartment manager. How can I help you?
A. I wanted to know if that apartment on Main Street is still for rent.

A. I'm interested in the apartment on Main Street.
B. It's still available. Do you want to see it?

B. I'll have an application form with me. You can fill it out if you're 
  interested.
A. Should I bring anything with me?
B. No. I only need to check your driver's license.

A. May I speak to the apartment building manager, please?
B. I'm the manager. How can I help you?
A. I was hoping that the apartment on Main Street was still available.
B. Why, yes, it is. Would you like to get a look inside the apartment?

B. How about today at 6 o'clock?
A. Yes, I can be there at 6.
B. Sounds good. I'll see you at 6. Do you want directions?

B. If you like the place, you can fill out an application form. I'll bring one 
  with me.
A. Is there anything that I need to bring with me?
B. No. I won't need to see anything except your driver's license.

A. This is Janet Smith in apartment 23. Can I speak to the apartment manager?
B. Hi. How can I help you today?
A. Well, my window facing the empty lot is broken.
B. Oh, that's not good. What happened?
A. I dont know. I wasn't home when it happened.
B. Do you have any clue who might have done this?
A. I have a feeling that it might have been the neighborhood kids.
B. Why, what leads you to that suspicion?
A. Well, next to the broken glass was a baseball.
B. Well, a baseball is certainly solid evidence.
A. I saw them playing just before I left my apartment.
B. Well, did you recognize any of them?
A. No, I just took a quick look.
B. Well, it'll take a couple of days to repair it.
A. A friend of mine is in the business. How about if I call him?
B. That's okay by me. First, let me come see the damage.
A. Come on over. So does my friend charge you or me?
B. Since you didn't break it, you don't have to pay for it.
A. That's a relief. I thought I was going to get stuck with the bill.
B. If I knew which kid did it, I would bill his parents.

A. I'm Janet Smith in apartment 23. Is this the apartment manager?
B. Hello. What can I do for you today?
A. My living room window is broken.
B. Are you serious? Do you know what happened?
A. I am not really sure, because I was out when it occurred.
B. Do you have any idea who might have been behind this?
A. Something tells me it might be some of the kids in the complex.
B. What led you to think it might be the kids in this building?
A. I found a baseball near the broken glass.
B. Well, you can't ignore a baseball in your living room, can you?
A. I saw them in the lot just before I went out.
B. Do you know any of them?
A. No, I didn't pay any attention to who they were.
B. I'll call the window repairman, but it'll probably take a couple of days.
A. I could get fast service if I call a friend of mine.
B. I don't have a problem with that. Let me look at the damage first.
A. Okay, I'm waiting for you. But who does my friend give the bill to?
B. Since the kids broke it, your friend can bill me.
A. Whew! I was worried that I would have to pay for it.
B. Believe me, if I find out which kid broke the window, I'll bill his 
  parents.

A. This is Janet Smith in apartment 23. May I speak to the apartment manager?
B. Speaking. What can I do for you?
A. Something happened to my window. It's broken.
B. That doesn't sound good. Do you know how it happened?
A. I don't know the exact details.
B. Do you have an idea who might be responsible for the window?
A. I'm almost sure it is the local kids in the apartments.
B. How did you come to that conclusion?
A. There was a baseball in my living room along with the broken glass.
B. Well, at least there's no mystery about how it happened.
A. I saw a group of them playing in the lot just before I went out to my car.
B. Can you tell me which ones you recognized?
A. I just looked at them for a second.
B. I'll call a repairman, but it might take two days.
A. How about if I call a friend of mine who is a repairman?
B. That's no problem. I'll come by right now to look at the damage.
A. Okay. Come on over. But tell me, who pays for this?
B. You can pay for it, and I can reimburse you. Or he can bill me directly.
A. I'm glad to hear that. I didn't want to get stuck with the bill.
B. I will bill the kid's parents if I ever find out which kid did it.

A. Hello, I'm John Smith in unit 23. Am I speaking to the apartment manager?
B. This is he. How may I help you?
A. My window that faces the empty lot is broken.
B. I'm sorry to hear that. Why is it broken?
A. I can't tell you exactly how it happened.
B. Well, tell me what you think might have happened.
A. I've got a pretty good idea that it's the kids who live here.
B. Why do you think that?
A. Next to the broken glass in my living room was a baseball.
B. Well, you don't need Sherlock Holmes to figure this one out, do you?
A. Just before I went shopping, I saw them in the lot.
B. Can you give me a name or two, or a description?
A. I have absolutely no idea.
B. I'll call a repairman for you, but it'll probably take one or two days.
A. I could probably get it fixed today, because a friend of mine is a 
  repairman.
B. That's okay. But let me see the damage first. I'm coming over.
A. The glass is all cleaned up, so come on over. But do I pay for this?
B. No. I will pay your friend, or I will reimburse you if you pay him.
A. That's good news. I was worried you were going to make me pay for this.
B. You're not at fault. But the kid who did it is.

A. This is John Smith in unit 23. Is this the apartment manager?
B. Hi. What do you need today?
A. I've got a broken living room window.
B. I'm sorry about that. How did it get broken?
A. I've got a good idea, but I'm not exactly sure.
B. Well, why don't you give me a few details?
A. I would bet a dollar to a dime that it's one of the local kids.
B. Do you have any support for that charge?
A. A baseball was on my living room carpet. I don't own a baseball.
B. Well, it sounds like someone hit a home run.
A. I saw them playing ball in the lot just before I went to the market.
B. Do you know for sure who they were?
A. All I did was glance at them before I left.
B. If you like, I'll call a repairman, but it might take a few days.
A. How about if I call my friend? He's a repairman and could probably fix it 
  today.
B. Sure. Let me come over to see the damage right now, though.
A. Sure, come on over, but tell me, do I have to pay for this?
B. You're not responsible, so you don't pay. Tell him to bill me.
A. Well, lucky me. I was afraid that I was going to get stuck for the bill.
B. Maybe I'll install a camera on that end of the building to catch these 
  kids.

A. Can you give me a little more information about your apartment?
B. Sure, what can I help you with?
A. What kind of public transportation is near your apartment?
B. I'm not sure, but I believe there is a bus stop about three blocks away.
A. Do you know what direction that bus travels?
B. I'm sorry. If you check online, you can get that kind of information.
A. Okay, I'll just go online.
B. Okay. Good luck with your search.

A. Hello, I was hoping you could give me more info about your apartment.
B. I can try to help you. What would you like to know?
A. Is there access to public transportation near the apartment?
B. I'm pretty sure there's a bus stop within walking distance.
A. Do you know anything about the buses that stop there?
B. I don't know, but I'm pretty sure you can find out that stuff online.
A. I think the local library has bus info.
B. Good luck. The bus info shouldn't be too hard to find.

A. Can you give me a little more information about your apartment?
B. All right, what do you need to know?
A. What is the public transportation like near your apartment?
B. I don't use buses, but I think there's a bus stop a few blocks away.
A. Which route does the bus travel?
B. I wish I could help you, but I know nothing about the bus system.
A. I'll just check my phone book. It has lots of good information.
B. I'm sorry I couldn't help you more.

A. I was hoping you could give me more information about the apartment for 
  rent.
B. I can certainly try.
A. Do buses or trains run by the apartment?
B. I can't swear to it, but I think a bus stop is a couple of blocks away.
A. Where does the bus take you?
B. I don't want to lead you astray. You should check online.
A. My neighbor takes the bus. I'll ask him if he knows.
B. Bus line information should be pretty easy to find.

A. Could you give me a little more information about the apartment?
B. Sure, if I can. What do you want to know?
A. Is there a bus or train system near the apartment?
B. I'm pretty sure there's a bus stop only a few blocks away.
A. Do you know which buses stop there? 
B. I'm sure there's an 800 number or a website that could help you.
A. I don't have a computer. I'll just look in my phone book.
B. Bus line information should be pretty easy to find.

A. Hello, this is Albert.
B. Hi. I'm Jack. You called about the room for rent. Are you still interested?
A. Yes, I am.
B. I was wondering if I could ask you a couple of questions.
A. Shoot.
B. I just want to be sure that we get along.
A. I agree with you 100 percent--we must get along.
B. Are you a party animal?
A. Oh, no. I'm a very quiet person.
B. Great! Next: Are you neat or are you a slob?
A. I'm a pretty neat person.
B. Are you a night owl or a day person?
A. Early to bed, early to rise.
B. Finally, do you smoke?
A. Actually, I quit smoking four years ago.
B. Excellent answers. Do you have any questions for me?
A. Just one: Is there a parking lot?
B. Unfortunately, you have to park in the street.
A. Well, I'm desperate. I'll take it anyway.
B. Great! Let me know when you're ready to move in.
A. I think it will be tomorrow if that's okay.
B. No problem. I'll be here all day tomorrow.

A. Hello. You've reached Albert.
B. I'm Jack. Are you still interested in renting a room? 
A. Yes, very much so.
B. Would it be all right if I asked you some questions?
A. Fire away.
B. I just want to make sure that we are compatible.
A. That's a good idea. We need to get along.
B. Do you like to party?
A. I don't party, and I don't like people who do.
B. Great! Now, are you a neat person, or do you leave trash all over?
A. One of my mottoes is to clean as you go.
B. Do you sleep in or rise early?
A. I go to bed early, and I get up early.
B. And last, are you a smoker?
A. I can't stand cigarette smoke.
B. Excellent. Now, do you have any questions for me?
A. Only one. Where can I park my car?
B. I hate to tell you, but it's street parking.
A. I don't like it, but I need an apartment now, so I'll take it.
B. Great! Give me a call, and I'll help you move your stuff in.
A. Will tomorrow be okay with you?
B. That sounds good. I'll see you tomorrow.

A. Hi, this is Albert.
B. Hi, my name is Jack. You called about a room for rent. Are you still 
  interested?
A. Yes, more than you know.
B. I don't mean to pry, but could I ask you a couple of questions?
A. Ask away.
B. I don't want us to be roommates who don't get along.
A. Yes, we must get along if we are going to be roommates.
B. Is partying one of your priorities?
A. I'm a student. I don't have time to party.
B. Very good. Now, do you clean up after yourself?
A. I clean up my own mess, and I expect others to do so, too.
B. What time do you usually hit the sack?
A. Occasionally, I stay up late if there's a big test the next day.
B. What about smoking?
A. If I ever get elected President, I will ban smoking nationwide.
B. Very good. Now, would you like to ask me anything?
A. Yes, I have one question. Do I have to park in the street?
B. I'm sorry. Yes, you have to park your car in the street.
A. I hate street parking, but I need the apartment now.
B. Very good. Just call me when you're ready to move your stuff over here.
A. How about if I come over tomorrow afternoon?
B. Just ring the doorbell. I'll be here all day.

A. Hello, Albert speaking.
B. This is Jack. Are you still interested in renting a room?
A. Oh, yes.
B. Would you mind answering a couple of questions?
A. No problem.
B. Since we might be roommates, I want to make sure there's no friction.
A. You are right. We need to be compatible.
B. Do you go out to clubs or bars a lot?
A. I have been to only one nightclub in my whole life.
B. Good. Now, do you expect others to pick up after you?
A. Occasionally I might slip up, but usually I'm clean and neat.
B. What kind of hours do you keep?
A. The early bird gets the worm.
B. I hope you're not a smoker.
A. I can smell a cigarette from a mile away. It makes me gag.
B. Your answers are great. Now, do you have a question or two for me?
A. Just one question. What's the parking situation?
B. This place allows only one parking space per apartment, so you'll have to 
  park on the street.
A. I don't like it, but I guess I can live with it.
B. Okay, I think we'll be good roommates. Just call me when you're ready to 
  move in.
A. I can move in by tomorrow afternoon.
B. That's fine. I was planning on being home tomorrow anyway.

A. Hello, Albert here. 
B. Hi, Albert. I'm Jack. Are you still thinking about renting a room? 
A. Yes, I need a room badly.
B. Can I ask you a few questions?
A. I'm an open book.
B. I want to make sure that we get along okay.
A. I'm with you. We both need to live in harmony.
B. Do you like to drink and party?
A. I hate noise, and I hate loud people.
B. Excellent. Now, do you leave a trail of trash wherever you go?
A. A place for everything, and everything in its place.
B. Do you keep normal hours?
A. I'm usually asleep before the 11 o'clock news.
B. You don't have a cigarette habit, do you?
A. Cigarette smoking is the dumbest habit in the world.
B. I like your answers. Now, are there any questions you'd like to ask me?
A. Yes, is the parking off street, or on street?
B. You're not going to like this. It's street parking only.
A. That figures, nothing is perfect. But, I'll take it.
B. You know, I think we're going to hit it off. Call me when you're coming 
  over.
A. I can get all packed tonight and be there tomorrow.
B. Just come on over anytime. I'll be here the whole day.

A. Hi, Tom. This is Hannah from apartment 4C.
B. Oh, hi, Hannah.
A. There is something wrong with my garbage disposal.
B. Exactly what's going on?
A. When I turn on the disposal switch, all I get is silence.
B. When did this happen?
A. Well, about a week ago is when it started sounding strange.
B. Did you accidentally drop something in the disposal?
A. No. I only use it about once a week. I hardly ever put anything into it.
B. Actually, I've heard that too little use is bad for a disposal.
A. Well, no one ever told me that.
B. Did you try to turn it with the disposal key?
A. I don't have a key.
B. Well, I've got a spare key, so I'll come over to show you how to use it.
A. Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it.
B. If the key doesn't work, I'll have to call the repairman.
A. Well, if it doesn't work, it's no big deal.
B. Yes, but if something's broken, I like to get it fixed ASAP.

A. Tom, are you there? It's Hannah from 4C.
B. Hey, Hannah. Long time no hear from.
A. My garbage disposal refuses to work.
B. What happens when you turn on the switch?
A. When I turn on the switch, nothing happens.
B. When did you first notice this?
A. A week ago it started sounding different.
B. Did you put something in it that you shouldn't have?
A. I use it rarely. When I do use it, I put pasta or other soft food into it.
B. Maybe you haven't been using the disposal enough.
A. Sort of like an air conditioner in your home or car?
B. Exactly. However, sometimes you can get it going again by using the key.
A. What key?
B. A disposal key. I've got a spare one, so I'll come over to show you.
A. Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it.
B. If the key doesn't correct the problem, I'll have to call someone.
A. Well, like I said, I rarely use it so it won't be a problem.
B. Well, it's my nature to fix things as soon as I can.

A. Is anybody home? It's me--Hannah.
B. Hey, Hannah. How's everything going?
A. My garbage disposal isn't working.
B. Can you be a little more specific?
A. Nothing happens when I turn on the switch.
B. Do you remember how it started?
A. about a week ago I noticed a new sound.
B. You didn't drop a fork or anything into it, did you?
A. I don't use it very often. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it.
B. I've heard that disposals need to be run frequently.
A. That's interesting. I never heard that before.
B. Have you tried to turn it manually using the key?
A. I don't have a key, and I wouldn't know how to use it.
B. I've got an extra key. I'll show you how to use it.
A. I'm always willing to learn something new. Come on over.
B. The key might not work. Then I'll have to call the plumber.
A. If it works or doesn't work, it doesn't matter much to me.
B. Yes, but I prefer to fix things now instead of later.

A. Hello, Tom? This is Hannah in 4C.
B. Hi, Hannah. What can I do for you?
A. My garbage disposal went south.
B. Does it turn at all?
A. There is nothing but silence when I turn on the switch.
B. Did it die suddenly?
A. It started to make a weird sound last week.
B. You didn't try to grind up a dead body, did you?
A. No, that's against the law, isn't it? I only use it on soft food, maybe 
  once a week.
B. Strange as it seems, a disposal should be run frequently.
A. Once a week might not be enough, huh?
B. There's a key that will turn it manually to loosen it up.
A. Even if I could find this key, I wouldn't know how to use it.
B. How about if I bring one over and show you how to use it?
A. Great, come on over, and teach me all about garbage disposal keys.
B. The key isn't a guarantee. I still might have to call a repairman.
A. It's no big deal to me if you can fix it or not.
B. Well, we don't want the food that's in there to start to smell bad, do we?

A. Hi, Tom. This is Hannah calling.
B. Hi, Hannah. What's up?
A. I think my garbage disposal kicked the bucket.
B. Is it dying, or is it dead?
A. Turning on the switch is the same as not turning on the switch.
B. Did it make strange sounds before it croaked?
A. Last week I noticed that it sounded strange.
B. You haven't been putting mango or avocado seeds in there, have you?
A. I use the disposal rarely. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it.
B. I think a disposal freezes up when it's not used frequently.
A. You mean it's sort of like use it or lose it?
B. Try loosening it up by using the disposal key.
A. Disposal key? I have a house key and a car key, but no disposal key.
B. Well, I've got an extra key. I'll bring it over.
A. Okay, Come on over, and show me how to fix this thing.
B. Sometimes the key works, sometimes it doesn't. I still might have to call a 
  plumber.
A. Well, there's no big hurry, as far as I am concerned.
B. If we don't fix it sometime, your apartment might start to attract bugs or 
  rodents.

A. Yes, this is John Smith.
B. John, this is Terry Evans. I called to tell you I have good news.
A. Great, what is it?
B. The owner has approved your rental application. He enjoyed talking to you.
A. That's great. He seemed like a really nice guy.
B. Now, before you can move in, you need to pay some fees.
A. Fees, what kind of fees?
B. You know. First and last month's rent and security deposit.
A. Oh, those fees!
B. First and last is $2,500, and the deposit is $1,000. Just send me a check 
  for $3,500.
A. No problem, what's your address?
B. Send it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107.
A. So, when can I move in?
B. The first of next month. Just stop by my office and pick up your keys.

B. Sure. It's 626-555-3000.

A. John speaking.
B. John, my name is Terry Evans. I have good news for you.
A. I'm all ears. What is it?
B. Your rental application has been approved. The owner thinks you'll be an 
  excellent tenant.
A. Oh, that's so good. It makes my day.
B. Now, before you move in, you have to pay some fees.
A. Fees, what are you talking about?
B. You know--first and last month's rent, and the security deposit.
A. Oh, of course. When you said fees, I was thinking of parking fees or 
  something.
B. That will come to $3,500, 2,500 plus $1,000. You can send me the check.
A. I'll do that immediately. Where do I send it?
B. Mail it to 3035 E Foothill Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91107.
A. One more question. When can I move in?
B. You can move in on the first. Stop by here and pick up your keys.
A. Great! What's your phone number?
B. My number is 626-555-3000.

A. I'm John Smith. How can I help you?
B. Hi, John. This is Terry Evans. I've got some good news for you.
A. I hope you're from the lottery. Go ahead.
B. The apartment owner was impressed with your interview. He has approved your 
  rental application.
A. Oh, my gosh. That's wonderful news!
B. Of course, there are some fees to pay before you move in.
A. Fees? I don't remember anything about fees.
B. You know, the usual--first and last month's rent, and the security deposit.
A. But, of course. You cannot move in unless you pay such fees.
B. So, you can write me a check for $3,500. That's $2,500 and $1,000 deposit.
A. No sooner said than done. Where shall I mail it?
B. Just mail it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107.
A. So, when will I be able to move in?
B. Move in on the first. Come on by my office, and pick up your keys.
A. Sounds great! Tell me your phone number.
B. Certainly. My office number is 626-555-3000.

A. Yes, this is John Smith. How may I help you?
B. Hello, John. Terry Evans here. I'm happy to give you some good news.
A. What is it?
B. The apartment owner likes you. He has approved your rental application.
A. Oh, thank you. That's the news I was hoping to hear!
B. Before you move in, of course, you have to pay some fees.
A. Fees, I'm confused. What fees are you talking about?
B. You know, the security deposit, and the first and last month's rent.
A. Oh, I got it. I thought you were talking about something else.
B. Just send me a check for $3,500. That's the deposit of $1,000, plus $2,500 
  for rent.
A. Just give me your address, and I'll mail the check today.
B. You can send it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107.
A. So, when can I start packing? When can I move in?
B. Your rent will start on the first, so move in then. Stop by here for your 
  keys.
A. Very good! Now all I need is your phone number.
B. Call my office anytime at 626-555-3000.

A. Yes, I'm John Smith. What can I do for you? 
B. Hi, John. This is Terry Evans here. Do you want some good news?
A. Sure, let me have it.
B. The apartment owner likes you. He approved your rental application.
A. Wow, that's fantastic! I don't know what to say.
B. Now you can't move in, of course, until you've paid some fees.
A. Fees, I don't remember anything about fees.
B. Fees, like the first and last month's rent, and the security deposit.
A. Oh, yes, of course, those fees!
B. You can send me a check for the total--$2,500 plus $1,000 equals a total of 
  $3,500.
A. All I need is your address, and the check will be in the mail pronto.
B. My address is 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107.
A. Okay, got it. Now when will he let me move in?

  first.
A. Okay, give me your phone number, please.
B. You can always reach me, or leave a message, at 626-555-3000.

A. Hello, Nicole here.
B. Nicole, this is Richard. I think you know why I'm calling.
A. Oh, it's about the rent.
B. Yes, this is the second month in a row.
A. I thought there was a grace period.
B. There is no grace period in the rental agreement.
A. Oh, I guess I forgot.
B. Well, when can I expect the rent?
A. You'll get it by Monday.
B. Don't forget the $50 late fee.
A. Is that in the rental agreement?
B. The late fee is circled in red ink!
A. Oh, Well, I can't find my copy of the agreement.
B. If you're late next month, I might give you an eviction notice.

A. Hi, this is Nicole.
B. Hi, Nicole. Richard here. I think you've got a good idea why I'm calling.
A. Yes. It's about the rent, isn't it?
B. Yes, your rent is late. This is the second month in a row.
A. But I thought that I had a grace period.
B. I told you last month that the rental agreement contains no grace period.
A. Oh, I guess I was thinking about the last place that I lived.
B. Well, tell me when I'm going to get your rent.
A. I get paid tomorrow, so you'll get the check by Monday.
B. Don't forget to include the $50 late fee.
A. Are you sure a late fee is in the rental agreement?
B. How could you miss the late fee? It's circled in red ink!
A. I can't find my copy of the rental agreement. I know it's somewhere in my 
  apartment.
B. If you're late one more time, I'm probably going to evict you.

A. Hello, Nicole here. Who's calling, please?
B. Hey, Nicole. It's Richard. I'm pretty sure you know why I'm calling.
A. Yes, a dollar gets a dime that you're calling about the rent.
B. Nicole, for the second month in a row, your rent is late.
A. I thought you said there is a grace period.
B. No, I didn't. There was no grace period last month, this month, or any 
  month.
A. Maybe I'm confusing this place with my last place.
B. Well, I'm waiting to receive your rent check.
A. I get my money tomorrow, so I can pay you by Monday.
B. Remember, just like last month, you have to pay the $50 late fee.
A. I don't remember seeing a late fee in the rental agreement.
B. If you look at your agreement, you'll see the late fee circled in red ink!
A. I forget where I put my rental agreement.
B. One more late check, and you're looking at eviction.

A. Hello. This is Nicole.
B. This is Richard. Let's not play games. You know why I'm calling.
A. Oh, not again! You're calling about the rent.
B. Yes, your rent check is late, just like last month.
A. What happened to my grace period?
B. Why would there be a grace period this month? There wasn't one last month.
A. I guess I might be a little confused.
B. What day in the near future can I expect your check?
A. My boss told me he will pay me tomorrow. You'll get my check by Monday.
B. Remember to include the $50 late fee.
A. Are you sure the rental agreement included a late fee?
B. The red ink around the late fee in your agreement should tell you 
  something.
A. I seem to have lost my rental agreement.
B. Don't be late again, or you'll be evicted.

A. Hi, this is Nicole.
B. Nicole, it's Richard. You know why I'm calling.
A. Yes, I know. It's the rent, isn't it?
B. Yes, just like last month, your rent is overdue.
A. What about my grace period?
B. Are you getting Alzheimer's? There is no grace period in the rental 
  agreement.
A. Sometimes my memory isn't so good. Maybe I do have Alzheimer's.
B. I'm looking forward to receiving your check in the very near future.
A. Is Monday okay? I get paid tomorrow.
B. Remember that the check amount must include the $50 late fee.
A. Okay, if the rental agreement actually has a late fee, I'll pay the fifty dollars.
B. Look at your agreement. There's a big red circle around the late fee.
A. As soon as I find my rental agreement, I'll read it again.
B. I'm not giving you any more chances. Be late again, and you'll be evicted.

A. Hello, this is Betty.
B. Hi, Betty. Larry here. How many smoke detectors are in your apartment?
A. Actually, I have two.
B. Are the batteries fresh?
A. Both batteries are good.
B. Great. I need to come by and check them myself.
A. No problem, when are you coming by?
B. Thursday at noon. I'll let myself in if you're not there.
A. Okay, remember to lock my door when you leave.
B. I'll be in and out of there in just a few minutes.

A. Hello, this is Betty.
B. Hello, Betty. This is Larry. How many smoke detectors are on your ceiling?
A. I have two smoke detectors.
B. Do you have fresh batteries in both of them?
A. Both batteries are pretty fresh.
B. Very good. I have to come by there and check out all the detectors.
A. Very good, when do you think you'll be coming over?
B. I'll be by on Thursday at noon. You don't have to be there.
A. I won't be home. Just remember to lock my door, okay?
B. You won't even know that I've been there.

A. Hello, Betty speaking.
B. Hey, Betty. This is Larry. Tell me how many smoke detectors you have, please.
A. This apartment came with one, and I installed another one.
B. Are there fresh batteries in each of them?
A. Each detector beeps when the battery is low. They're not beeping.
B. Good. I'm calling all the tenants because I have to check all the 
  detectors.
A. Okay, What day were you thinking about dropping by?
B. I'll be at your building at noon on Thursday. If you're not there, I'll let 
  myself in.
A. If you're thirsty, you can grab a beer or soda out of my frig.
B. Thanks, but it'll only take me about two minutes to test them and leave.

A. Hi, this is Betty.
B. Hi, Betty. It's Larry. I need to know how many smoke detectors are in your 
  apartment.
A. There was one when I moved in. Then I added one.
B. Do both detectors have fresh batteries?
A. I always keep them fresh. I don't want to burn to death.
B. That's good. I have to come by there and check out all of the detectors.
A. Not a problem. When will you be here?
B. I'll be letting myself into all the apartments on Thursday at noon.
A. If it's raining, make sure you wipe your feet before you come inside, okay?
B. Not to worry. I'll be in and out of your place in a flash.

A. Hi, this is Betty.
B. Hi, Betty. It's Larry. Can you tell me how many smoke detectors you have?
A. There are two smoke detectors in my apartment.
B. Do you know how new the batteries are?
A. I'm very afraid of fires. I change the batteries every Labor Day.
B. Good. I'm calling all the tenants before I come by to test the detectors.
A. My detectors are ready for you. When will you be visiting?
B. This Thursday at noon. But you don't have to be there.
A. Okay, just pardon the mess when you come in.
B. You'll never even know that I was there.

A. Hello, Nicole? This is Jimmy in 309.
B. Hello, Jimmy. What's up? 
A. You're not going to believe this.
B. Believe me, I think I've heard everything.
A. I can't find my mailbox key.
B. Is that all? That's a lot better than losing your car keys.
A. I had a duplicate, but I can't find it either.
B. If you come by my place, I can loan you a key.
A. There's no emergency. All I get is junk mail and bills.
B. Can you wait till Wednesday? I'll make you two more keys.
A. Sure, that'll be fine.
B. Okay. I'll see you Wednesday. But it's going to cost you $2 per key.

A. Can I speak to Nicole? This is Jimmy in apartment 309.
B. Hi, Jimmy. This is Nicole. What's happening?
A. You probably never heard this one before.
B. Don't bet on it. I've been an apartment manager for a long time.
A. I've looked everywhere, but I can't find my mailbox key.
B. Well, that's pretty minor. I lost my car keys and house keys once.
A. To make matters worse, I can't find my duplicate either.
B. If you want, come over here and I'll lend you a key.
A. No, there's nothing vital in the mailbox. Just junk and bills.
B. If you can wait until Wednesday, I'll make two more keys for you.
A. Wednesday's fine. 
B. Okay, I'll bring them by Wednesday. Have $4 ready for me.

A. Hi, Nicole. This is Jimmy in 309.
B. Hello, Jimmy. Can I help you?
A. I've got a little problem.
B. Tell me your problem, and maybe I can help.
A. I've looked everywhere, but I can't find my mailbox key.
B. Well, that's pretty minor. I lost my car keys and house keys once.
A. As if that wasn't bad enough, I also misplaced the duplicate.
B. Well, if it's an emergency, come by here and I'll lend you a key.
A. No, even if there's a bill in there, it can wait.
B. If you don't mind waiting until Wednesday, I'll make two more keys for you.
A. Oh, I can wait, believe me.
B. Okay, see you Wednesday. They're not free, you know. It'll be $4.

A. Hey, Nicole. It's Jimmy in 309.
B. Hi there, Jimmy. What can I do for you?
A. I screwed up, and I need your help.
B. Tell me the specific problem. Let me see what I can do.
A. I've torn my apartment apart, but I can't find my mailbox key.
B. Well, you should be grateful it wasn't your car keys.
A. On top of that, I couldn't find the duplicate either.
B. If you need to get in there, come by and borrow a key.
A. No, my mailbox is usually empty anyway.
B. Well, then, I'll make you two more keys on Wednesday.
A. No problem. I can wait till Wednesday. Maybe there'll be something in there 
  by then.
B. Okay. Have $4 ready for when you see me Wednesday.

A. Hello? This is Jimmy in 309.
B. Hi, Jimmy. This is Nicole. What's going on?
A. Maybe you can get me out of a small jam.
B. Well, I can certainly try.
A. Somehow, I managed to lose my mailbox key.
B. Believe me, losing a mailbox key is a lot better than losing your car keys.
A. I've got a duplicate somewhere, but I haven't been able to find it either.
B. If you absolutely can't wait, come over here and borrow a key.
A. No, I doubt that there's anything important in my mailbox, if there's 
  anything at all.
B. Well, if there's no emergency, I can make you two more keys on Wednesday.
A. Not a problem. All my fan mail can wait till then.
B. Okay, see you Wednesday. Have $4 for me, and I'll give you a receipt.

A. Good afternoon, Jim. This is Olivia.
B. Oh, hi, Olivia. How can I help you?
A. I'm going to be moving out.
B. Oh, really? When are you leaving?
A. I'll be leaving on the last day of June.
B. Any particular reason?
A. I got a new job.
B. Congratulations! What is it?
A. I'm going to be an ESL instructor at Pasadena City College.
B. Great! By the way, what's ESL?
A. ESL stands for English as a Second Language.
B. Well, I'm glad it wasn't your neighbors causing you to move.
A. Just because they play their TV loud enough for the whole complex?
B. Yes, I know. I'm going to have another talk with them.
A. Anyway, it's been nice knowing you for these past few years.
B. You, too. Keep in touch, and good luck with your new job.

A. How's it going, Jim? This is Olivia.
B. Hello, Olivia. What's up?
A. I wanted to let you know that I have to move out.
B. I'm sorry to hear that. When are you moving?
A. The thirtieth of June.
B. May I ask why you're leaving?
A. I found a new job.
B. Good for you! What's your new job?
A. I am an ESL teacher at Pasadena City College.
B. Very good! What does ESL mean?
A. ESL means English as a Second Language.
B. Well, I'm glad you're not moving because of your neighbors.
A. I can't tell you how happy I'll be not to have to listen to their TV.
B. Yes, I'm going to tell them one more time to turn down their TV and keep it 
  down.
A. You've been a good apartment manager and a good person. I'll see you in 
  June.
B. Thank you. I hope your new job and new apartment are good for you.

A. Hey, Jim. How are you? Olivia here.
B. Hi, Olivia. What's going on?
A. I just wanted to give you notice that I'm moving.
B. Oh, that's too bad. What's the moving date?
A. I'll be gone on the last day in June.
B. Can I ask you why you're moving?
A. I've been looking for a long time, and I finally found a good job.
B. Very good! What's your new job?
A. I'm going to teach ESL at Pasadena City College.
B. Good for you! What does ESL stand for?
A. ESL is English as a Second Language.
B. Well, I'm glad you don't feel you're being chased out by your neighbors.
A. Their TV is so loud you'd think they were stone deaf.
B. I'll tell them one more time to turn down their TV. Then I'm going to evict 
  them.
A. Thanks for all your help over the past few years.
B. Thanks. Good luck with your new neighbors and your new job.

A. Hi, Jim. It's Olivia.
B. Hey, Olivia. What's happening?
A. I'll be moving out in a while, so I wanted you to know.
B. Well, that's not good news. When are you moving?
A. The last day of June.
B. Is something wrong with your apartment?
A. No, not anything new. But I just found out that I've been hired for a new 
  job.
B. Great! What is the new job?
A. I'm going to be an ESL instructor at Pasadena City College.
B. That's great! ESL is some kind of electronics class?
A. ESL is a class for students who are learning English as their second 
  language.
B. I'm glad that your neighbors aren't the reason that you're moving.
A. I won't miss having to listen to their darn TV.
B. I'm giving them one more warning about their TV. Then they're out of there.
A. I appreciate what a good apartment manager you've been these past few 
  years.
B. It's been nice knowing you, too. Good luck teaching LES.

A. Hello, Jim. It's Olivia.
B. Hi, there. What can I do for you today?
A. You should know that I'll be moving out in a while.
B. Gee, that's too bad. What day do you plan to leave?
A. June 30 is my last day.
B. I hope it's not your neighbors or the latest rent increase.
A. No, neither one. I got lucky. I found a new job.
B. Hey, give me five! Good for you! What is it?
A. I'll be teaching ESL at Pasadena City College.
B. Great! Is ESL a class about the Internet?
A. No. ESL is English for students whose native language is not English.
B. I was worried that you were moving because of your neighbors.
A. Whoever my next neighbor is cannot possibly be as loud as those people.
B. I'm going to give them 30 days' notice if they don't turn that TV down.
A. Thanks for everything. I'll give you the keys on the thirtieth.
B. You've been a very good tenant. Good luck with your new SLE job.

A. I don't have any more cash, and I have to get on another bus 
to get home.

A. I wanted some chips at lunch today, so I spent it.
B. That was a bright idea.
A. Do you have some change I can borrow?

A. I think it's time we started driving.
B. Yes, I agree.

A. When is the bus going to get here?

B. I hate having to take the bus every day.
A. So do I, you can never count on public transportation.
B. Exactly.
A. I really can't stand being at the bus stop in the heat and rain.
B. I know what you mean.
A. We're going to have to get a car of our own.
B. I couldn't agree with you more.

A. I want to get on the bus already.

A. It was supposed to be here thirty minutes ago.

A. We need to get a car.
B. I completely agree with that.

A. Is this our bus stop?
B. I think this is it. Get off.
A. Dude, where are we at?
B. I have no idea.
A. I thought this was the right stop.
B. It doesn't look right to me.
A. Did you make us get off early?
B. I think we did.
A. I should not have listened to you.
B. I really thought this was our stop.
A. Now we have to walk.
B. Maybe we should just wait for the next bus.

A. I'm not sure, is this our stop?
B. Yeah, get off the bus.
A. Do you have any idea where we are?

A. This place doesn't look like Altadena.
B. That's true, and we have been on this bus for a while.

A. What do you mean it should?
B. I'm not completely sure if it really does.
A. Dude, are we on the right bus?
B. I'm almost positive that this is the right one.
A. It doesn't look like we're on our way to Altadena.
B. We have been riding this bus for a long time.
A. What does that sign say?
B. I think it says Temple City.

A. Why not?
B. It's just a waste of cash.
A. Actually, it'll save you money.

A. So, are you going to buy one?
B. I will.

A. Have you bought a bus pass yet?

A. You get your bus pass?

A. Is that one better?
B. It's better because it doesn't tie up your phone.
A. What do you mean by that?

A. That'll make it impossible for me to use.
B. Exactly. With DSL you don't have that problem.

A. I'd like to have internet on my computer.
B. Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get?
A. What are my options?
B. You can either get dial-up or DSL.
A. Which one would you recommend?

A. Why is DSL better?
B. It's a lot better because it doesn't tie up your phone line.
A. What exactly does that mean?
B. Well, with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line.
A. That means that I can't use my phone and the internet at the same time, 
right?
B. That's right. You won't have that problem with DSL.

A. Have you been coming to this Laundromat long?
B. I have been washing clothes here since a few years ago.
A. Why is that?
B. It doesn't cost me as much to wash here.
A. I've just started doing my clothes here.
B. Why are you washing your clothes here now?
A. My washing machine broke down.
B. You should just pay someone to fix it.
A. It's too expensive to get it fixed.
B. So you're just going to wash here?
A. Yes, I think that's what I'm going to have to do.
B. It costs less to wash here.

A. How long have you been washing clothes here?

A. I have no choice.
B. Washing clothes at a Laundromat costs a lot less money.

A. Do you wash clothes here often?
B. I have been coming here for the past few years.
A. Why do you wash here?
B. It's actually a lot cheaper for me to wash my clothes here.
A. I've only washed my clothes here a couple times.
B. Why don't you wash clothes at home?
A. I would, if my washing machine wasn't broken.
B. Why don't you just get it fixed?
A. I can't afford it.
B. So you plan on washing your clothes here from now on?
A. That's my only option right now.

A. I'm not sure about how to operate the washer and dryer.
B. What's the problem?
A. I need help turning them on.

A. That's it?
B. There's nothing else to it.
A. Thank you very much.
B. You're welcome. Let me know if you need anything else.

A. I need help using the washer and dryer.
B. Tell me what the problem is.

B. Do you have some quarters?
A. I didn't know I needed change.
B. The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar.
A. Where do I put the change?
B. The quarters go into the slot. You have to push the slot in, and the machine 
will turn on.
A. Is that everything that I have to do?
B. That's all there is.
A. I appreciate you helping me with this.
B. If you need anything else, just let me know.

A. Could you tell me how to use the washer and dryer?
B. What do you need help with?
A. Do you know how to turn them on?
B. Do you have any change?
A. I need change for the machines?
B. You need to put 50 cents into the washer machine and a dollar into the dryer.
A. So what do I need to do?
B. The machines will turn on once you put the quarters into the slot.
A. That's really all I have to do?
B. That's everything.
A. Thanks for all your help.
B. I'm here if you need any more help.

A. I'm returning your phone call.
B. I'm glad that you could get back to me so fast.
A. No problem, but what were you calling about?
B. I needed to talk to you about your son.
A. Is he messing up in school?
B. He was acting up in class one day last week.
A. What was he doing?
B. He wouldn't stop talking throughout the class.
A. I don't know what's gotten into him.

A. Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late?
B. This is true, but it must've slipped my mind.
A. Regardless, all you had to do was give a call.
B. I know. I should've called.
A. Come home late one more time, and you'll find your stuff outside.
B. You want to throw me out over this?
A. That's right, maybe then you'll respect my rules.
B. That's fine, because if I leave, then your rules won't matter.

A. I don't want to keep this radio.
B. No problem. May I have your receipt, please?
A. Sorry. I could not find it.
B. We can't give you a refund without a receipt.
A. You know, I bought it at 3 p.m. yesterday.
B. I wish I could help you, but it's store policy.
A. Every rule has an exception.
B. Perhaps if you try customer service.
A. Yes, they might be able to help me.
B. They're upstairs. Good luck!

A. I'm returning this radio.
B. Certainly. Can I see your receipt, please?
A. I looked everywhere, but I couldn't find it anywhere.
B. I'm sorry, but you can't return the radio without your receipt.
A. Even though I just bought it yesterday?
B. Are you sure that you looked everywhere for the receipt?
A. I looked everywhere, twice!
B. Well, customer service is right upstairs. Maybe they can help.
A. Great! I'll take the escalator.
B. If they can't help you, nobody can.

A. May I exchange this DVD player?
B. Certainly. Do you have your receipt?
A. Here you are.

B. I'm sorry. I'll get you a new player.
A. At first, I thought it was me.
B. Okay, here's a new one for you.

A. I'd like to exchange this DVD player.
B. Of course. Do you have your receipt?
A. Here it is.
B. Now, could you tell me why you want a different one?

A. All my friends tried to get it to work.
B. I hope this one works better for you.

A. I want to exchange this DVD player.
B. No problem. Do you have your receipt?
A. That's one thing I never forget.
B. Now, what seems to be the problem?
A. This DVD player won't play DVDs.
B. Well, at least you kept your receipt. One moment, please.
A. I spent almost an hour trying to make it work.
B. If this one doesn't work, just bring it back.

A. Can I exchange this DVD player?
B. Let me see your receipt, please.
A. I always keep my receipt.
B. Could you tell me what the problem is?
A. When I hit “Play,” nothing happens.
B. Yours is the first one that's been returned.
A. Nothing I tried would make it work.
B. You might want to try playing this one before you leave.

A. I need to exchange this DVD player, please.
B. That won't be a problem if you have your receipt.
A. Here you go.
B. Now, if you'll just tell me the problem, please.
A. It won't play my DVDs.

A. I don't know. I trust this brand. This was a fluke, I think.
B. You're right, this is a good brand. This new one should work just fine.

A. Excuse me. Can you help me?
B. Certainly. What can I do for you?
A. May I exchanged an opened DVD?
B. Certainly, as long as you have your receipt.
A. Here you are.
B. I'm sorry, but you're only allowed to return items within 30 days.
A. Is there any way I can exchange it?
B. I'm afraid not.
A. I am not coming here anymore.
B. I'm sorry, but please don't blame me.

A. Pardon me. May I ask you a question?
B. Of course. How can I help you?
A. I opened this DVD. Can I still return it?
B. No problem. May I have your receipt?
A. Here you go.
B. Oh, it looks like you bought this more than 30 days ago.
A. Can't you bend the rules just a little bit?
B. I'm sorry.
A. You just lost yourself another customer.
B. Don't get mad at me, please. I don't make the rules.

A. Can you help me, please?
B. No problem. What is your question?
A. Is it possible to return an opened DVD?
B. Sure, as long as you have your receipt.
A. Here you go.
B. I'm sorry. You can't return something you bought more than 30 days ago.
A. Yes, but this is only day 32. Isn't that okay?
B. I'm sorry, but rules are rules.
A. Well, this is ridiculous. I won't shop here anymore.
B. Well, if I was the boss, the rules might be different.

A. Can you give me a little help, please?
B. That's what I'm here for.
A. Can I return this DVD even though I already opened it?
B. That won't be a problem if you have your receipt.
A. It's right here in my wallet.
B. Oh, the date on the receipt says that you bought it too long ago to return 
it.
A. But aren't there any exceptions?
B. If I make an exception for you, I have to do it for everyone.
A. How do you expect to keep loyal customers?
B. I wish I could help you, but I didn't make the rules.

A. Would you help me, please?
B. It would be my pleasure.
A. I want to return this opened DVD. Is that possible?
B. No problem at all. Do you have your receipt?
A. Let me dig it out of my wallet.
B. I'm sorry. You can't return something more than 30 days old.
A. There must be some way around this.
B. I'm sorry, but I have to tell everyone the same thing—no.
A. That's the dumbest rule I ever heard of.
B. Maybe the rules will change if we lose all our customers.

A. I'll just check out a few other stores.
B. I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

A. Pardon me. Is this dress on sale?
B. Actually, the sale ended yesterday.
A. You know, it's only one day later. How about giving me the sale price?
B. I'm sorry, but I can't change the price that's in the computer.
A. Let me think about it. Maybe I'll wait until the next sale.
B. Take a look around. Maybe you'll see something else you like.

A. Is this dress on sale?
B. It was on sale—yesterday.
A. Still, couldn't you sell it to me today at the sale price?
B. I'm sorry, but I'd lose my job if I sold it to you at yesterday's sale price.
A. I had my heart set on buying this dress.
B. Well, feel free to browse. We have other items on sale today.

A. Am I right in thinking that this dress is on sale?
B. I'm sorry. You're one day too late for the sale.
A. Couldn't you still sell it today at the sale price?
B. I'm sorry. One day can make a big difference sometimes.
A. No problem. Other stores are having sales. I'll check them out.
B. Before you go, let me show you some other dresses that are on sale.

A. Am I mistaken, or is this dress on sale?

A. I'm glad these batteries are on sale.
B. I'm sorry. These batteries are not on sale.
A. But that's what the ad says.
B. I'm sorry. If you look at the ad again, you'll see that the other brand is on 
sale.
A. You're right. I misread the ad.
B. Yes, many people make that mistake.
A. You can't blame them. It's a confusing ad.
B. You're right. Many ads are like that.
A. As long as I'm here.
B. Just one second, and I'll get you the batteries that are on sale.

A. It's about time these batteries went on sale.
B. I'm sorry. These aren't on sale today.
A. You're kidding me. The ad says they're on sale.
B. Yes, the other brand of batteries is on sale.
A. I see. I've got the wrong brand.
B. Yes, it's an easy mistake to make.
A. The ad is written in a misleading way.
B. I agree. It seems like all ads are meant to confuse you.
A. It's not the first or last time.
B. Hold on, and I'll get you the batteries that are on sale.

A. You don't often find these batteries on sale.
B. I'm not sure that these batteries are on sale today.
A. But the ad says they're on sale.
B. Yes, batteries are on sale, but not this brand.
A. What do you know? I picked up the wrong brand.
B. Yes, several customers have made that mistake today.
A. Like many ads, it's deliberately confusing.

A. I should know better by now.
B. If you can wait one minute, I'll bring you the batteries that are on sale.

A. This is the first time I've seen these batteries on sale.
B. I'm sorry, but they aren't on sale today.

B. Yes, the ad says that the other brand of batteries is on sale.
A. Yes, I misread the ad.
B. Believe me, you're not the first person to make that mistake today.
A. No wonder people make a mistake. The price is in big letters, and the brand 
is in tiny letters.
B. You're right. You have to read an ad two or three times sometimes.
A. You have to be careful with every ad you read.
B. It's okay. I'll go get you the batteries that are on sale.

A. These batteries should be on sale more often.
B. I don't think these batteries are on sale.
A. Look at the ad. It says they're on sale.
B. You're right. Batteries are on sale, but not this brand of batteries.
A. I didn't pay attention to the brand name.
B. Several people have misread that ad already today.
A. People make the mistake because the ad is misleading.
B. I agree with you. Ads can be very tricky.
A. I don't know when I'll ever learn.
B. No problem. I'll bring you the batteries that are on sale. I'll be right 
back.

A. Here is your breakfast!
B. Thanks so much. Miss, I believe I ordered my eggs scrambled, and these are 
fried.
A. Sorry, your friend over there ordered fried eggs, and I gave you his by 
mistake.
B. Oh yeah. Here, I will just trade with him.
A. Here are your pancakes, sir.
B. But I ordered waffles!
A. I am so sorry!
B. That's OK. I will eat my eggs and bacon, and you can take my pancakes back.
A. Good, sir. I will take care of that right away.
B. Thank you so much!

A. I believe you ordered the Grand Slam breakfast.
B. Oh, good! You know, I am looking at my plate and I ordered scrambled eggs, 
not fried.
A. I just noticed that I accidentally brought you your friend's breakfast.
B. I can just trade with him, thank you.
A. And pancakes for you, sir.
B. I am sorry, but I think I ordered waffles.
A. I am sorry that I misheard you.
B. Just please take my pancakes to trade for waffles. While I am waiting, I will 
eat my bacon and eggs.
A. I will get straight back to you with your waffles.
B. I would appreciate that.

A. One Grand Slam breakfast for you!
B. Thanks. You know, I just noticed that these eggs are fried, and I ordered 
scrambled.
A. Thank you for pointing that out. I mistakenly gave you your friend's 
breakfast.
B. Not a problem. I can just trade my plate with his.
A. A special order of banana pancakes for you!
B. Pancakes? I don't like pancakes. I ordered waffles.
A. I am so sorry, sir!
B. I can eat my bacon and eggs while you are exchanging my pancakes for waffles.
A. I will go trade those pancakes for waffles right now.
B. That would take care of it, thank you.

A. What a wonderful dinner!
B. Thank you. I am glad that you are enjoying it.
A. Where did you get your fantastic recipes?
B. I grew up cooking. My mother shared her recipes with me.
A. I especially like the wonderful chicken dish.
B. That is a special coconut ginger chicken with rice dish.
A. Is that shrimp in the soup?
B. Yes, do you like it? I added a little extra lemon grass and some sea 
vegetables.
A. I am happy that the wine I brought for you works well with this meal.
B. Yes, thank you for bringing the wine. It really complements the meal.

A. This is a great meal!
B. Thank you. I am glad that everything turned out so well.
A. Who taught you how to cook this well?
B. I took a cooking class at the Culinary Institute.
A. Wow, what is in this chicken dish?
B. Isn't that great? That is coconut ginger chicken with rice.
A. Is the soup a shrimp soup?
B. Yes, there is shrimp in there along with sea vegetables and lemon grass.
A. I think I got lucky in choosing a wine that blends with this meal.
B. I appreciate you bringing the wine. It goes well with the chicken.

A. I really love this meal.
B. Thanks. I was hoping that you would all enjoy this meal.
A. Where did you learn to cook these amazing dishes?
B. I got a really wonderful cookbook for my birthday and decided to try out a 
few of the recipes.
A. The chicken is out of this world!
B. I love that dish as well. It is coconut chicken with rice.
A. I was wondering if there was shrimp in the soup.
B. Yes, that soup has a shrimp base. I also added sea vegetables and lemon 
grass.
A. It worked out well that the wine that I brought to share seems to blend well 
with this meal.
B. I love this wine! It goes very well with the chicken.

A. George, how is your chicken?
B. My chicken tastes all right, but it is pretty dry. How is your fish?
A. My fish is pretty dry too.
B. It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long. It doesn't 
seem fresh.
A. Yes, it seems that way to me also.
B. How are your vegetables?
A. My vegetables are very soggy.
B. Mine are the same way. It seems like they've been overcooked.
A. I don't usually complain, but I think that we should mention this to the 
waiter.
B. I agree. Maybe they can bring us some better food.

A. George, is your chicken OK?
B. It tastes great, but it is really dry. Is your fish all right?
A. My fish is very dry.
B. I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it. 
A. That's exactly what I was thinking had happened.
B. Are your vegetables OK?
A. The vegetables are kind of mushy.
B. So are mine. I think they left them cooking too long.
A. The food here is usually good, so I think that we should tell the waiter that 
there is a problem.
B. I think that you are right. Maybe they can give us a free dessert or 
something.

A. Does your chicken taste all right?
B. The chicken tastes wonderful, but it is kind of dry. Is your fish OK?
A. My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry.
B. It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us.
A. Yes, maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight.
B. Are your vegetables a little mushy?
A. The vegetables seem to not be very fresh.
B. Mine aren't so good, either.
A. I usually enjoy the meals here, so I think that we should tell the waiter 
that there is something wrong with this meal.
B. I think that we should let someone know. They will probably want to fix the 
problem.

A. Do you want some dessert?
B. No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress?
A. Here comes our waitress with our check.
B. The service here has been really great, don't you think?
A. Yes, the service was quite good.
B. So, let's look at the check. The total is $36.00.
A. How much do you think we should leave for a tip?
B. Usually people leave 15 percent, but this was exceptional service. I am thinking 
that maybe 20 percent would be appropriate.
A. I agree that 20 percent would be just about right.
B. OK, so that will bring her tip to $7.20. Add it to the $36.00 and the total 
is $43.20.
A. Yes, what a nice dinner that was!
B. We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon.

A. Would you like some more coffee?
B. No thanks. I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill.
A. The waitress is bringing the bill right now.
B. This waitress has really been on top of things, hasn't she?
A. Yes, this waitress did a great job.
B. OK, let's see what the damage is. The total for our meal is $36.00.
A. What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip?
B. Fifteen percent is a normal tip, but she really did a great job. What do you 
think about 20 percent this time?
A. Yes, 20 percent would be perfect.
B. Her tip will end up being $7.20 plus the bill of $36.00. The total will be 
$43.20.
A. Yes, that was one fantastic meal!
B. I agree. Maybe we can come back again next week.

A. Would you like to order anything else?
B. No, I'm good. All we need now is our check.
A. The waitress is walking over here with our check even as we speak.
B. I have never had bad service at this restaurant, but this time was really 
exceptional.
A. Yes, she really went out of her way to make this a pleasant dining 
experience.
B. Let's take a look at our bill. The total price for our dinner is $36.00.
A. How much money should we leave for a tip?
B. I know that 15 percent is a normal tip, but I really thought that this waitress went 
out of her way for us. What do you think about tipping her 20 percent?
A. She definitely deserves 20 percent for a tip.
B. So we can add her tip of $7.20 to the bill of $36.00 and the total will be 
$43.20.
A. Yes, what a wonderful meal!
B. It absolutely was a great meal. We'll have to return here for lunch sometime.

A. Do you want some dessert?
B. No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress?
A. Where is our waitress anyway?
B. Yes, the service hasn't been the best. Is that our waitress over there?
A. I'll walk over and get the bill, since I don't think the waitress is coming 
over here any time soon.
B. Good idea. Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together.
A. So the bill is $36.00.
B. How much do you think we should leave for a tip?
A. My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip.
B. I agree, but we don't really know the whole story. There may have been 
problems in the kitchen beyond her control.
A. Let's leave 10%, so that we at least leave something for the service.
B. I agree. We will leave $3.60 for the tip.

A. Would you like some more coffee?
B. No thanks. I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill.
A. Good luck finding the waitress!
B. The service this evening has kind of sucked. Is that our server over there?
A. I'll go get the check, since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way.
B. Good. I'll just stay here until you get back.
A. So the total is $36.00 for our dinner.
B. How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves?
A. I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service.
B. I kind of feel the same way, but they may have just been really short-staffed 
tonight.
A. I think that we should leave 10%.
B. $3.60 will be the right amount for the tip.

A. Would you like to order anything else?
B. No, I'm good. All we need now is our check.
A. Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight, hasn't she?
B. I think that is our waitress over by the bar. Boy, the service has not 
been good this evening.
A. She doesn't appear to be headed this way, so I will go get the check.
B. Good. Just bring it back and we'll total it together.
A. Our total for dinner is $36.00.
B. What do you think would be the right amount to tip?
A. I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received.
B. I agree that it was bad service, but I heard one of the other waiters 
mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job.
A. I believe that 10% is just about right.
B. I think that a tip of $3.60 will be the right amount to leave.

A. So, how did you like the restaurant?
B. I thought that it was very good. 
A. I felt the food was excellent.
B. What did you like the best?

A. What do you think the problem was?
B. Well, they are pretty new. I just didn't feel that they were ready to open 
yet.
A. How did you feel about the food?
B. The food wasn't all that exciting.
A. I didn't think that the service was good, either.
B. Yes, the service certainly didn't add to the experience.

B. Maybe we could try it again in a few months when things have settled down.

A. How do you feel about that restaurant?

A. What kind of car insurance do you have?
B. I went with the Automobile Club.
A. Why did you choose that company?
B. I looked at the price of the type of insurance that I wanted.
A. What should I think about in choosing services?
B. There are websites that will figure out what coverage is right for you.
A. What did you end up buying?
B. Well, my car is very old, so I didn't worry so much about what it would cost 
to repair it. I did buy a lot of coverage for fixing someone else's car.
A. Have you ever had to use your insurance?
B. I never had to use my insurance.

A. When you insured your car, what kind did you buy?
B. I decided to buy from GEICO.
A. What influenced your choice of companies?

understand what you need to think about.

B. I carry a lot of liability insurance because I own a house and need to 
protect it from a lawsuit.
A. Did you ever get into an accident and need your insurance?
B. I was in an accident and was happy that I had good insurance to cover it.

bought your new car?
B. State Farm seemed like the best deal for me.
A. How did you make that decision?
B. I compared rates and services available.
A. Where can I get help in figuring out what I need to purchase for coverage?
B. You can pick up a pamphlet at your insurance company that will explain the 
options to you.
A. What did you decide to cover yourself for?
B. I pretty much carry the average amount in all categories as the agent 
recommended.
A. How many times have you actually used your insurance?
B. I was in an accident, but it was the other person's fault and their insurance 
covered it.

A. I am interested in buying auto insurance.
B. Sure, I can help you. Did you bring all of your registration papers?
A. Yes, I brought everything with me.
B. Is your car with you?
A. Yes, it is out in the parking lot.
B. Wonderful. Let's go out and check to see what shape it is in.
A. OK, can you help me figure out what I should insure my car for?
B. I will look it up on the Blue Book list and we will factor in its condition.
A. What else do I need to consider?
B. Yes, you need to figure in liability for damage to the other car as well as 
injury issues as well.

A. Good morning, I need to buy car insurance for the used car I 
just bought.
B. Yes, no problem. Do you have your registration and Certificate of Ownership 
with you?
A. Yes, it is all right here.

you?

B. Did you bring your car with you?
A. Yes, it is parked on the street.
B. Fine, I need to go out with you to check your car for wear and tear.
A. Fine, how will I know how much I should insure my car for?
B. After looking at your car, I will use the Blue Book price and we will 
consider the condition of the car.
A. Are there other considerations when I insure my car?
B. We always need to think about property damage, damage to other vehicles, and 
injury.

A. I really like that car and I am thinking of buying it.
B. Yes, I agree. Do you want to take it to a mechanic to have it checked out?
A. I already took care of that yesterday.
B. That's good. Have you discussed the price with the seller?
A. Yes, I think we've agreed upon a fair price.
B. Have you set up your financing to pay for this car?
A. Yes, my parents are going to loan me the money.
B. That's good. Would you like me to go talk to the seller with you and drive 
your car home?
A. That would be a great help!
B. Glad to be of help. I can't wait to see your new car!

A. That car is exactly what I want, so I probably should buy it.
B. From what I see, it's a good deal. Should a mechanic check it out for you?
A. A mechanic looked at it for me on Tuesday when I first looked at it.
B. It's good that you took care of that. Have you agreed upon a price with the 
seller?
A. Yes, he was willing to lower his price a bit and I'm good with that.
B. Do you know how you are going to pay for this car?
A. Yes, I have already pre-qualified for a loan with my credit union.
B. You are very well prepared! I could go with you to talk to the seller and 
help you get your car home.
A. I appreciate the offer of help!
B. It will be my pleasure to help you. I am looking forward to riding in your 
new car.

A. I think that that car drove really well and is a good deal.
B. It seems to be a good choice for you. You might want to have a mechanic take 
a look at it just to be sure.
A. My friend is a mechanic and he came and looked at it for me this morning.
B. That was smart of you to think ahead. Have you and the seller agreed upon a 
price?
A. Yes, he is willing to accept the price that I offered him.
B. Have you thought about how to pay for your car?
A. I saved up enough money to pay cash for this car.
B. You've really thought this through. Let me go with you to make the payment 
and drive your car home for you.
A. That would make it a lot easier for me.
B. Let's go take care of that right now. I really want to see your new car!

A. Thank you for letting me test drive the car.
B. So do you think that you would like to purchase this car?
A. You know, I am not interested in purchasing the car right now.
B. What's the problem? We can at least sit down and maybe work out a deal.
A. Actually, I have several other cars to look at before I make my decision.
B. What didn't you like about the car? Maybe I can fix something for you.
A. It is a combination of things, but I appreciate your time.
B. I have some other cars you might want to look at.
A. Again, I appreciate your time but I will not be purchasing this car.
B. Give me a call if you change your mind. Have a good day.

A. I appreciate you letting me take the car out for a spin.
B. Why don't you come over here and we can work out the details of the purchase?
A. I don't think that this is the car for me at this point in time.
B. It's a great deal. Let's talk price. Maybe you'll change your mind.
A. This is only the first car that I've looked at.
B. Is there something in particular that didn't look good to you?
A. It isn't one thing in particular, but I think I can do better for my money.
B. I really think that you should reconsider.
A. Thank you again for your time.
B. Thank you for stopping by. Good luck in your search for a car.

A. I enjoyed taking the car out for a test drive.
B. Isn't that a great car? Let's work out the details of purchase.
A. I will not be purchasing the car today.
B. Why don't you take a second look at that car? You'll see that it is as good a 
deal as you are going to get.
A. I need to compare this car to others to make an informed choice.
B. You said on the phone that this is the kind of car you wanted. What has 
changed your mind?
A. I just really need to make sure that I get the best car for my money.
B. You know, you can look around but I just don't think that you are going to 
get a better deal for your money.
A. I will continue looking around for cars and will get back to you if I change 
my mind.
B. OK, then. Have a good day.

A. I was thinking about buying this used car, and was wondering 
if you would take a look at it for me to see if it has any problems.
B. Sure, pull up over there and we'll take a look.
A. I just wasn't sure what to look for.
B. The first thing you do is look for any signs of wear both inside and out. We 
will also look at the body for signs of major repair.
A. Someone told me that I could go online and see if the car is listed as having 
been in a major accident.
B. Yes, that's right. Next, we will turn on the engine and I will check under 
the hood to look at the hoses and belts.
A. Should we take the car for a drive?
B. Yes, but before we pull away, let's check to make sure that the radio, turn 
signals, lights, and seats all work properly.
A. As I am driving what should I be checking?
B. You want to make sure that the brakes don't pull to one side and that the car 
has good alignment and acceleration.
A. Thanks for your help.
B. You are welcome. Enjoy driving your car!

A. Could you take a few minutes and see if there are any 
problems with this used car that I am thinking of buying?
B. I am happy to help. Just pull up and we'll give it a good look.
A. I don't know much about cars.
B. We need to look inside and outside for signs of an accident or major damage. 
Also, we need to look for wear on the tires.
A. If I go online I can also check to see if the car has been involved in a 
major accident.
B. Yes, you can check the history of the car online. Next, we need to turn on 
the engine and take a look at the belts and hoses.
A. Will you take a drive with me to check handling?
B. A test drive would be good. But first let's make sure that the turn signals, 
radio, lights, and seats work properly.
A. On a test drive, what should I look for?
B. We are checking for solid braking and good overall handling.
A. I appreciate you helping me figure out what to look for.
B. My pleasure. This seems to be a solid car and a good choice for you.

A. I want to buy this used car, but I need help figuring out if 
there are any problems with it.
B. I can help you with that. Drive the car over by the garage and we'll check it 
out.
A. I know some things to look for, but I know there are other special things to 
look for.
B. Always start with looking for signs of major damage that may have been 
repaired and also check tire wear.
A. If the car has been in a major accident, that should have been recorded 
online.
B. Right. All major accidents should have been recorded. Next start the car up, 
pop the hood, and we'll take a look at the belts and hoses.
A. I would like for you to take a test drive with me.
B. We'll do that in a minute, but first we should check that the radio, turn 
signals, and all of the lights work properly.
A. As we drive, what am I checking for?
B. You want to make sure that the alignment is good, that the engine accelerates 
smoothly, and that the car can safely brake to a stop.
A. I like knowing what to look for when buying a used car and appreciate the 
help.
B. This car is in good shape and should give you no major problems. Enjoy it!

A. I am buying a used car and don't know much about financing 
it.
B. I can help you. Do you have a down payment?
A. Yes, I have saved up three thousand dollars for a down payment.
B. Good, because you will not be able to get a loan without putting some money 
down on the car.
A. I don't know where exactly to get a loan.
B. Other than friends or family, you can go to a bank, credit union, or use the 
dealer financing if you bought the car off a car lot.
A. What is the best choice for financing?
B. It depends. The worst financing deal is usually at the dealer, but they will 
oftentimes give you a loan when a bank turns you down.
A. What do I need to have with me when I apply for the loan?
B. You will need a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip for the car. 
Before the loan is complete, you will need to show proof of insurance. Good 
luck!

A. Can you help me learn about financing options for a used car?
B. I would love to help you with what I know. I am assuming that you have a down 
payment.
A. Yes, I already borrowed some money from my parents for the down payment.
B. That will work. A bank or finance company will not loan you money without a 
down payment.
A. I am not sure who will loan money to me.
B. You can apply for a loan at a bank, credit union, or approach the used car 
dealer who sold you the car. You might also try family and friends.
A. Who offers the best interest rate?
B. A credit union will usually give you the best interest rate, but the dealer 
will almost always give you some type of loan.
A. Do I need any documents when I apply for a car loan?
B. Be sure that you take a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip. You will 
have a few days to produce proof of insurance. Enjoy your new car!

A. I need help figuring out how to pay for a used car that I am 
thinking of buying.
B. I would be happy to help you. Have you saved up a down payment?
A. I will be getting money from selling my old car.
B. You really need that money so that a bank or finance company will loan you 
the rest of the money that you need. 
A. Who gives loans out to people wanting to buy cars?
B. Usually people go to a bank, credit union, or, if they bought the car at a 
car lot, they might use the dealer finance company.
A. What is the best place to get financing?
B. The dealer will charge you a higher interest rate, but sometimes they are 
your only choice if you are just starting out.
A. Will I need some documentation when I apply for the loan?
B. Just make sure that you bring them your last pay stub and a copy of the pink 
slip. You can then work on getting insured. Enjoy your new car!

A. I need to go to the DMV and don't know how to make an 
appointment with them.
B. First of all you need to figure out if you really need to be there 
in person. Sometimes you can take care of your business at the Automobile Club 
or at the DMV website.
A. If I do need to go in, how can I make an appointment?
B. You can either make an appointment by going online or by calling the phone 
number listed on their website.
A. What if I just show up there?
B. If you have all day to wait and a good book to read, that might work for you.
A. Is the DMV open on Saturdays?
B. Due to state budget cuts, the DMV is no longer open on Saturdays.
A. I think that you have just convinced me to join the Automobile Club!
B. Yes, the Automobile Club takes all the pain out of DMV transactions!

A. How can I make an appointment at the DMV?
B. You could check the DMV website or see if the Automobile Club could help you. 
Many things can be taken care of without actually going in to the DMV in person.
A. How do I make an appointment if I have to actually go in?
B. You have two choices. You can call them at the number listed on their website 
or you can contact them online.
A. Can I just walk in and get help?
B. Without an appointment, you will be waiting for many hours. I would not 
advise it.
A. Can I take care of this on a Saturday?
B. Unfortunately, the DMV is no longer open on Saturdays.
A. It probably would be easier for me to join the Automobile Club.
B. The Automobile Club has many benefits, and taking care of your DMV 
transactions is one of the best benefits.

A. Can you help me figure out how to make an appointment with 
the DMV?
B. I would try to avoid going in to the DMV in person. If you are a member of 
the Automobile Club, they oftentimes can take care of things for you or you can 
try the DMV website.
A. It would be nice not to have to go in but if I have to, how do I make an 
appointment?
B. The easiest way to contact them is online, but they also have a phone number 
listed on the website if you prefer to call them on the phone.
A. What do they do if you just show up with no appointment?
B. That is not a good way to go. You could be left waiting for many hours and 
there is no guarantee that they will see you at all!
A. What about going to the DMV on Saturday?
B. For a while the DMV was open on Saturday, but not anymore.
A. I think that the Automobile Club idea was a good suggestion.
B. You should check out the Automobile Club. I think you would enjoy being a 
member.

A. This car is exactly what I want!
B. I am glad that you like it. I've had good experiences with this car.
A. So, how much do you want for the car?
B. Well, the price in the paper was five thousand dollars.
A. Yes, I know, but I think that might be a little high for this car.
B. I might be able to come down a little on the price.
A. How about selling the car for four thousand?
B. No, that's way less than I could accept. However, I could accept forty-five 
hundred.
A. That sounds fair to me.
B. It's a deal then. Thank you!

A. I really love this car!
B. Great! I was hoping that it would go to a driver who appreciates it.
A. How much are you willing to take for the car?
B. As I am sure you noticed, the price on the window is five thousand dollars.
A. Don't you think you could come down a bit on the price?
B. You seem like a nice person. Maybe I could lower the price a bit.
A. Would you sell it to me for four thousand?
B. I am thinking more in the line of four thousand five hundred.
A. I'll take it then!
B. Perfect! That works for both of us.

A. I am definitely interested in buying this car.
B. Wonderful! It's good to find a person who really needs this car.
A. What is the price for this car?
B. The price I listed on eBay was five thousand dollars.
A. I was thinking that maybe you might be willing to lower the price a bit.
B. You know I just got a good deal on my new car. I think I can afford to knock 
a little off of this car.
A. I was thinking that four thousand would be a good price.
B. I couldn't go that low, but I could sell it for forty-five hundred.
A. That would work well for me.
B. It's done then. I've enjoyed doing business with you.

A. How much does this car cost?
B. Well, come on in and we'll sit down and discuss that right now. How much do 
you want to pay?
A. I really was just wondering what the price is.
B. Well, figuring in tax, license, dealer prep, and registration, I can let this 
car go for fifteen thousand dollars.
A. I was thinking a little lower than that.
B. Whoa! Let's keep talking here. I am sure we can work something out. What 
price are you thinking is fair?
A. I was thinking more like thirteen thousand dollars.
B. You know, you look like you are a sweet kid. I'll give it to you for fourteen 
thousand dollars.
A. That would be a good price if the car was in great shape, but it is 
registered as having been in an accident.
B. OK, thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty, and that's my final offer.

A. If I want to buy this car, what will it cost me?
B. Let me get my contract out, and we'll figure that out for you right now.
A. Can't you just tell me what it costs?
B. You know, I am prepared to offer you a great deal today on that car. With 
tax, license, registration, and dealer prep, the total will be fifteen thousand 
dollars.
A. Fine, I'll come back later with my father, who is a lawyer, and we can talk 
then.
B. I am sure that we can work something out. What price were you thinking would 
be a good deal for you?
A. Thirteen thousand would be more like it.
B. Fourteen thousand for this car is a good price. For that I am practically 
giving it away.
A. Normally that would be a good price, but that car has been in an accident.
B. Yes, I see your point. Thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty is my final 
offer.

A. How much money for this car?
B. Yes, that car is beautiful, isn't it? Come on inside and we'll discuss the 
price.
A. I just want to know the price.
B. Fifteen thousand out the door! What a deal! That will, of course, include 
tax, license, registration, and dealer prep.
A. I appreciate your help, and I'll see you later.
B. Oh, you look like a smart person. What price would be fair to you?
A. I think that thirteen thousand would be fair for this car.
B. I can see that you are a smart buyer. Fourteen thousand is my best price.
A. If the car hadn't been in an accident, that would be a good price, but it has 
a few minor problems.
B. Thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty is my final offer.

A. I really love the look of this car.
B. Would you like to test drive this car?
A. Yes, I would love to take it for a drive.
B. I'll go get the keys, and you can get out your Driver's License and Proof of 
Insurance.
A. Here's my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance.
B. Well, just sign this card, and we'll be on our way. Don't forget to buckle 
your seatbelt!
A. Can I take it on the freeway to check for acceleration?
B. That would be fine; just don't exceed the speed limit!
A. This car handles great, and I love it!
B. I am glad that you like this car.

A. The styling of this car really appeals to me.
B. Would you like to take this car for a spin?
A. That would be a great idea.
B. Fine, all I'll need from you is your Driver's License and Proof of Insurance.
A. I've got my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance ready.
B. OK, after you sign this card, we'll take a spin. Make sure you buckle your 
seatbelt!
A. I would like to go on the freeway to test it for speed.
B. As long as you don't exceed the speed limit, that would be fine.
A. Whoa, this car has wonderful pickup!
B. Yes, this is a very popular car.

A. Wow, what a cool car!
B. How about taking this car out for a drive to see if you like how it handles?
A. I would enjoy seeing how it handles.
B. While I'm getting the keys, you just need to take out your Driver's License 
and Proof of Insurance.
A. I found my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance.
B. Great! Sign this card, buckle your seatbelt, and we'll hit the road.
A. I want to take the car up to freeway speed.
B. Take a left at the next signal to enter the freeway. Just keep it under the 
speed limit!
A. This car has a nice smooth ride, even on the freeway.
B. You know, I've driven it myself, and I agree with you.

A. Now I've decided to buy this car, how do I transfer the title to myself?
B. Actually, your best bet is to contact the Automobile Club or to go to the DMV website.
A. Basically, what will I need to do?
B. Both buyer and seller need to transfer the ownership by filling out a Change 
of Ownership form and signing over the Certificate of Title, which will be either pink or rainbow. 
A. Will I have to pay any fees?
B. All of the transfer fees are the responsibility of the buyer.
A. How much will it cost to transfer the title?
B. The DMV has a special formula that they use to calculate the fees. They will figure it out for you.
A. Do I need a Smog Certificate?
B. No, only if your car was manufactured before 1975.
A. Where do I take my forms?
B. You can take them to the DMV. You have ten days to complete the process.

A. I don't really know all that much about the paperwork involved in buying a used car.
B. If you are a member of the Automobile Club, they can help guide you through the process, or just go to the DMV website.
A. What is the big picture of what I will need to take care of?
B. The car has a pink or rainbow Certificate of Title, which both the buyer and seller need to sign. They also both need to fill out the Change of Ownership form.
A. Who pays the fees to transfer the ownership?
B. The buyer must pay all of the fees.
A. Will it be really expensive to transfer the title?
B. The DMV will calculate the fees for you when you submit the paperwork.
A. What about a Smog Certificate?
B. No, your car was built after 1974, so you will be fine.
A. Where can I turn in my forms?
B. If you are a member of the Automobile Club, you can turn in your forms to 
them.

A. Can you help me figure out how to transfer the title of the car I wish to buy so it will be registered in my name?
B. You can go to the DMV website for information or, if you are a member of the Automobile Club, they can be very helpful.
A. Can you just fill me in on what needs to be done?
B. When you both fill out and sign a Change of Ownership form and sign the Certificate of Title, the ownership will be transferred.
A. Are there any fees involved?
B. As the buyer, you are responsible for all of the fees.
A. How much money will I have to pay to transfer the title?
B. The only way to calculate the fee is to turn your paperwork in to the DMV, and they will figure it out for you.
A. Do I need to take the car in for a Smog Certificate?
B. No, your car is a newer model, so you won't need one.
A. Whom do I give my forms to when they are completed?
B. Check online for special situations, but usually you can mail your forms in to the DMV.

A. Where is the best place to buy a used car?
B. I have always purchased my used cars from an advertisement in the paper, but 
actually you have many options.

B. You could look on the Internet. Craigslist is best, as most of the cars 
listed there are sold locally.

for sale?
B. The best place is CarMax, which is a very large used car lot.
A. Where is CarMax?
B. There are many of them. You can look on the Internet or in the phone book for 
the one closest to you.

as students are moving away.

are a lot of them.

B. The school bulletin board can have some great deals, as many students sell 
their cars before they return home or as they get better paying jobs.

A. Where did you buy your last used car?
B. I found my last one in an advertisement in the newspaper, but there are a lot 
of other places to look for used cars.

B. My friend bought his used car off of Craigslist. It works out better than 
eBay because the cars listed are located close by.

place.

B. The DMV windows are set up for different tasks. What are you here to do?

box, and I will call you when your name comes up.
A. Thanks for helping me.
B. You are welcome. May I see your current Driver's License?

you're done!

on the Internet?

A. Is there a problem, officer?
B. Did you not notice that stop sign that you ran through?
A. I'm sorry, I didn't even notice it.
B. You didn't see it?
A. I honestly couldn't see it because of the bushes growing over it.
B. That's true. Those bushes are a problem.
A. I swear that I didn't mean to run it.
B. I can understand why you didn't stop for it.
A. Are you going to give me a ticket today, sir?
B. Under the circumstances, I think I'm just going to let you go with a warning.
A. Thanks a lot.

A. What's the problem?
B. There was a stop sign back there that you didn't stop for.

B. That's all right. Make sure to look closely next time.

A. What's up, officer?
B. Are you aware that you ran through that stop sign?
A. There was a stop sign?
B. How could you not notice it?
A. If there really was a stop sign, I couldn't see it because of the overgrown 
bushes.
B. You're right. The bushes are covering the sign.
A. If I saw the stop sign, I would've stopped for it.
B. Now that I think about it, I can see how you missed it.
A. Am I getting a ticket for this?
B. I'll let you off with a warning.
A. Thank you, I really do appreciate that.
B. Don't worry about it. I need to have something done about those bushes.

A. Is there a problem, officer?
B. I stopped you for driving through a red light.
A. Did I really?
B. You didn't know?
A. I had no idea that I ran it.
B. Don't you know that yellow means slow down?
A. Yes, sir.
B. Why'd you speed up instead?
A. I really have no excuse, sir.
B. I'll have to write you a ticket.
A. I understand, and I am very sorry.
B. Here's your ticket.

A. What's wrong, officer?
B. You do realize that you ran a red light, don't you?
A. I did?
B. You didn't see the red light?
A. I'm sorry for running it, but I really didn't know.
B. Didn't you learn that red means stop?
A. I know that.
B. Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light.
A. I'm not sure.
B. I'm giving you a ticket for this.
A. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.
B. Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light.

A. Why'd you pull me over?
B. Are you aware that you drove through a red light?
A. I ran a red light?
B. Yes, you did.
A. I apologize, but I didn't realize that I did that.
B. Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down, not speed up?
A. I did learn that.
B. So, then why did you speed up?
A. I don't know what to tell you.
B. I'm going to have to write you a ticket.
A. I understand.
B. Here you go. Don't do that again.

A. You're here today to argue your ticket?
B. I am.
A. Plead your case.
B. The police officer that pulled me over said I was speeding.
A. Were you speeding when you got pulled over?
B. I was not speeding.
A. How fast were you going?
B. In a 40 mph zone, I was only going about 35.
A. Seeing as the officer that pulled you over isn't here, I'll let you go.
B. Do I still need to pay the fine?
A. No, you don't.
B. I appreciate your understanding.

A. You want to argue your ticket today?
B. Yes. That is why I'm here.
A. Tell me your argument.
B. I was pulled over for allegedly speeding.
A. Are you sure you weren't speeding?
B. To be honest, I really wasn't.
A. What speed were you going?
B. I was under the speed limit. I was going 35, when the speed limit was 40.
A. I'm just going to let you go, since the arresting officer isn't here.
B. What about my ticket? Do I still need to pay?
A. Don't worry about it.
B. I'm so glad for your help.

A. Are you here about your ticket?
B. Yes, I am, Your Honor.
A. What is your argument?
B. Your Honor, the police officer pulled me over for speeding.
A. You must've been speeding.
B. No, Your Honor, I was not.
A. Tell me how many miles per hour you were going.
B. I was going 35 in a 40 mph zone.
A. That's fine, so I'll let you go with a warning.
B. So, I don't have to pay the ticket?
A. You won't have to pay the fine.
B. Thank you very much, Your Honor.

A. What are you here for today?
B. I need to fight this ticket that I got.
A. Is the arresting officer here?
B. Yes, he is, Your Honor.
A. Plead your case.
B. I was told by the officer that I ran a red light. That information isn't 
true.
A. Why would the officer lie?
B. I'm not sure, but the signal had a camera on it.
A. Did the camera take a picture of your license plate?
B. No, my picture wasn't taken.
A. There was no picture taken, so I'll let you go.
B. Thank you very much, Your Honor.

A. Why are you in court today?
B. I got a ticket, and I would like to fight it.
A. Is the officer that pulled you over here today?
B. He's here.
A. Tell me what happened.
B. The officer says that I ran a red light, but I didn't.
A. The officer wouldn't lie about that.
B. He must've, because the signal had a camera on top of it.
A. There was no picture taken of your license plate?
B. I don't believe it took my picture.
A. I'm just going to let you go.
B. I appreciate that.

A. What are you doing here today?
B. I would like to fight my ticket.
A. Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today?
B. Yes, the officer is here today.
A. What's your case?
B. I was pulled over for running a red light, but I never did.
A. Do you believe that the officer lied?
B. There was a camera on the signal. So, he was obviously lying.
A. Your license plate was caught on camera?
B. A picture of my license plate was never taken.
A. Since there is no picture of your license plate on record, I'm going to let 
you go.
B. Thank you. I'm glad that you believe me.

A. I need to pay the fine on my ticket.
B. Do you have the ticket with you?
A. Yes, I have my ticket with me.
B. Let me see your ID.
A. I forgot to bring that with me.
B. You need it to pay your fine.
A. Why can't I just give you the money for the fine?
B. Because, I need to see a photo ID in order to verify who you are.
A. I think I understand.
B. All right, come back and bring your ID.
A. So once I pay this off, my record will be cleared?
B. Once you pay it, your record will be cleared.

A. Could I pay for my parking ticket?
B. I need to see your ticket. Do you have it?
A. Here's my ticket right here.
B. I'm going to need to see your ID.
A. I don't have it.
B. You can't pay your fine without your ID.
A. I don't understand why I can't just pay you.
B. We have to make sure that the person issued the ticket is the one paying it.
A. I get it now.
B. Just come back when you have your ID with you.
A. Will my record be cleared after I pay the fine?
B. Only if you pay your fine.

A. I have a parking ticket to pay for.
B. Did you bring your ticket?
A. Yes, I remembered to bring my ticket with me today.
B. Did you bring your ID?
A. I didn't bring my ID.
B. You're going to need your ID to pay the ticket.
A. What do you need my ID for?
B. We have to know that this ticket is really yours.
A. All right, I see what you mean.
B. Next time you come back, bring your ID.
A. Will everything be cleared from my record?
B. Yes, everything will be cleared.

A. I would like to purchase some health insurance. 
B. Have you ever purchased health insurance before?
A. I have health insurance now, but I want to look into other choices.
B. Do you know if you are interested in an HMO or a PPO?
A. Could you explain the difference to me?
B. To clarify it for you, with a PPO you pay more but you get to choose your 
    own doctor.
A. When I pay for a service, is the payment the same for a PPO or HMO?
B. The payments are quite a bit higher for the PPO, but you can go anywhere 
    you like. 
A. How much will an HMO cost me per month?
B. Go to our website and fill in the questionnaire. Once we have all of your 
    information, we can give you a quote.

A. I am calling to purchase health insurance.
B. Do you have health insurance now?
A. I was on my parents' policy, but I need to start buying my own.
B. You can purchase an HMO or a PPO. Do you know what you want?
A. I don't know what I want.
B. Let me explain it to you. An HMO is a little cheaper, but you can only 
    choose certain doctors.
A. When I go to the doctor, do I pay the same out-of-pocket expenses for a 
    PPO?
B. The payments are a little lower for an HMO as long as you go to their 
    doctors.
A. How much will a PPO cost me per month?
B. We need to factor in many things. Why don't you come in, and we will have 
    you fill out a questionnaire.

A. I need information on purchasing health insurance.
B. Is this the first time you have had health insurance?
A. This is my first time buying health insurance.
B. You have a choice of HMO or PPO. Do you understand the difference?
A. I am not sure what those are.
B. Just so you understand completely: An HMO is a little cheaper, but you 
    have limited choices of which doctor you choose.
A. If I need to use my insurance, are the payments the same for a PPO and 
    HMO?
B. By going to the providers on the HMO list, you save money in 
    out-of-pocket expenses.
A. Can you give me a comparison between a PPO and an HMO?
B. We can mail you a questionnaire and when we have all of your information, 
    we will mail you a quote.

A. What seems to be the problem?
B. Oh, my God! It's my stomach. It's killing me!
A. Where does it hurt the most?
B. Right here! It hurts right here!
A. How long has it felt like this?
B. I felt OK when I woke up, and then, suddenly, I had this really sharp 
    pain.
A. Do you have a history of stomach pain?
B. No, and I haven't done anything out of the ordinary.
A. I think that we are going to have to get you to an emergency room 
    right away.
B. Thank you for helping me.

A. Can you tell me where it hurts?
B. I am so glad they called you. It feels like something is really wrong 
    with my stomach!
A. Does it hurt when I push here?
B. It's mostly on my right side. Right here!
A. Have you been feeling this way for awhile?
B. I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner, but this morning 
    the pain got really bad!
A. Have you eaten anything unusual lately?
B. No, not that I remember.
A. We are going to take you to an emergency room right now.
B. I will feel better when I know what the problem is. Thank you.

A. Where are you feeling the pain?
B. I can't stand up! My stomach is killing me!
A. Can you put your hand where it hurts the most?
B. It hurts smack in the middle of my gut!
A. Did this just come on suddenly?
B. I felt OK until an hour or so ago, and then I just doubled over.
A. Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently?
B. No, and I don't usually get a lot of stomachaches.
A. We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is.
B. I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this. 
    Thank you.

A. Sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you could drive me to the 
    emergency room.
B. Of course. What is the problem?
A. I am running a really high fever of 105 degrees, and I have a rash on my 
    stomach.
B. If you can, go and unlock the back door, so I can get in when I get there 
    if you fall asleep.
A. I can do that when I get off of the phone.
B. Do you know where your driver's license and insurance card are?
A. I already had them out before I called you.
B. Where is your nearest emergency room?
A. It's just a few blocks away.
B. Fine, I am on my way. I'll be there in about five minutes.

A. I hate to call you this late at night, but could you possibly help me 
    get to the emergency room?
B. We will come right over. What happened?
A. My temperature went up to 105, and I have a rash!
B. Make sure that someone unlocks the back door, so I can get in if you fall 
    asleep before I get there.
A. I will do that in a minute.
B. Make sure that you have your insurance card and driver's license where we 
    can grab them.
A. I know right where they both are.
B. Is there an emergency room near you?

A. The doctor sent me over here to have my blood drawn.
B. Certainly, please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve.
A. What is this test for?
B. Well, today your doctor wants us to check your white blood cell count.
A. What does that tell him?
B. Well, if it is elevated, you might have an infection.
A. Will the blood test hurt?
B. It is only a little pin stick. I am going to put a tourniquet on your arm 
    to puff your veins up.
A. Ouch!
B. There we go! I got the blood that I needed.

A. My doctor says that I need a blood test.
B. I can help you with that. Just have a seat and roll up your left sleeve.
A. What are you taking my blood for?

B. If your white blood cell count is off, it could signal an infection 
    somewhere in your body.
A. Is a blood test painful?

    feel like a little pin prick.
A. My God, that hurts!

    the vein easier to find.

    coming in!

    while.

    any worse.

    scheduled appointment time.

A. Have you been having any problems lately?
B. No, but the nurse at school says that I should have my blood pressure 
    checked.
A. Do you have a history of high blood pressure?
B. No, I have never been told that I have high blood pressure.
A. High blood pressure is called the silent killer because it hardly ever 
    has symptoms. 
B. How do you check for high blood pressure?
A. We are going to use this cuff here, and it will give me a reading.
B. What do the numbers mean?
A. They tell me how much your heart is working at rest and when pumping 
    blood.
B. Good. That will help me know how I am doing.

A. How have you been feeling lately?
B. I've been feeling a little light-headed lately.
A. Has your blood pressure been high before?
B. If I have high blood pressure, it is news to me.
A. Usually people with high blood pressure have no symptoms, so we call it 
    the silent killer.
B. What do you use to check for high blood pressure?
A. I am going to put a cuff on you to get a reading.
B. What does the reading tell you?
A. I get an idea of the pressure in your arteries when your heart is pumping 
    blood versus at rest.
B. I hope that the test results show me to be really healthy.

A. Have you been feeling OK lately?
B. My coach wants you to check my blood pressure.
A. Has anyone ever told you that you had high blood pressure?
B. I don't have any symptoms of high blood pressure.
A. People with high blood pressure seldom know they have it, which is why we 
    call it the silent killer.
B. What test do you do for high blood pressure?
A. We will pump air into this cuff to get a reading.
B. When you get the reading, what information does it give you?
A. It tells me how hard your heart pumps blood and how much your arteries 
    relax at rest.
B. I am hoping that this test goes well for me.

A. So, how are you feeling today?
B. I'm pretty tired. I haven't been sleeping well.
A. Do you have enough time to get the right amount of sleep?
B. I have enough time. I just can't seem to fall asleep and stay asleep.
A. What time do you usually go to bed?
B. I don't have one time in particular. I just go to sleep whenever I feel 
    tired.
A. Have you been under a lot of stress lately?
B. I just lost my job, and I am unsure about being able to find another one.
A. Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed?
B. I haven't ever tried that, but it sounds like a good idea.

A. How have you been doing lately?
B. Actually, I haven't been sleeping well. I am kind of out of it.
A. Is there some reason why you can't get enough sleep?
B. I go to bed, but I just can't get comfortable enough to stay asleep.
A. When do you turn in for the night?
B. I usually try to go to bed around 11:00 or so during the week.
A. Do you have a lot on your mind when you try to go to sleep?
B. My mother is ill with cancer, and I think about her a lot.
A. Do you ever meditate or read before bedtime?
B. I usually watch a lot of television before I go to bed. Maybe I should 
    try something else to help me quiet down.

A. Has everything been OK with you lately?
B. I haven't been able to get a good night's sleep lately. I'm exhausted!
A. Have you been too busy to get enough sleep?
B. I try to go to sleep, but I just can't stay asleep.
A. How late do you try to go to sleep?
B. I go to bed when I finish my work.
A. Has anything in your day-to-day life been bothering you lately?
B. I am worried about how I am going to pay my tuition.
A. You might consider listening to relaxing music as you go to sleep to 
    clear your head.
B. Doing something relaxing before I go to sleep sounds like a plan.

A. Good morning, how are you doing today?
B. I have been feeling pretty good, Dr. Smith. 
A. So, I can see by your chart that you are here for your annual physical.
B. Yes, I am playing on the tennis team this year, and they are requiring me

A. Would two weeks from now be a good start date for you?
B. That would be great. I could give notice to my current job and start with you 
on that date.
A. Glad that will work for both of us; I look forward to seeing you then.

A. This is Ray. May I speak with Lee?
B. Yes, this is Lee speaking.
A. Lee. How are you today?
B. Oh, things are going great. What's up?
A. I was wondering if you could meet me tomorrow for lunch?
B. Sure! Where did you have in mind?
A. I was thinking of Joe's in the village.
B. I love that place. Sure, let's go there.
A. Fine then, I'll meet you around twelve.
B. I'll see you there. Look forward to it.

A. Good morning, this is Ray speaking. Is Lee in?
B. Hi, Ray. This is Lee.
A. Good morning, Lee. How is it going with you today?
B. Things are wonderful. What can I help you with?
A. Could we meet for lunch tomorrow to discuss the new project?
B. That would be great. What restaurant did you have in mind?
A. We could go to Lozano's downtown.
B. That would be perfect. It's a nice quiet place to meet.
A. I'll see you there around twelve then.
B. I am looking forward to meeting with you. See you then.

A. May I speak with Lee? This is Ray.
B. Lee here.
A. Lee, I thought that was you. How's it going?
B. I am doing well. How can I help you?
A. I would like to treat you to lunch tomorrow so I can get some suggestions 
from you.
B. Sounds like a plan. Where would you like to meet?
A. How about the new Chinese place next door?
B. Yes, that would work well for me.
A. I'll join you around twelve for lunch then.
B. It's a go then. See you there.

A. Excuse me. I was wondering how to order office supplies.
B. We have a requisition form on the company web site. What type of supplies do 
you need?
A. I need paper, ink cartridges, and paper clips.
B. How quickly will you need your supplies?
A. I need all of my supplies right away.
B. We also will have to check your department budget. Do you know how much money 
you have for office supplies?
A. I will check to see what my budget is.
B. Would you like these supplies delivered or would you like to pick them up?
A. Please deliver them to my office.
B. Fine, well just send the form to us and we will let you know as soon as your 
supplies come in. Have a good day!
A. Thank you!

A. I need help in ordering my office supplies.
B. You can print out a copy of the Order Supply Form from our company web site 
and turn it into me. What will you be needing?
A. I need ink cartridges, staples, and Post-its. 
B. Will you need all of them right away or can some wait?
A. Some of these can wait but there are a few things that I need right away.
B. You can only buy supplies that you have a budget for. Do you know what your 
budget is?
A. We have plenty of money for office supplies.
B. You can pick these supplies up or they can be delivered to your building. 
Which would you prefer?
A. I want to pick them up.
B. Well, just finish the request and we will contact you when the supplies come 
in. Have a good day!
A. You too!

A. How do I order the office supplies that I need?
B. Fill out this form with whatever you need. What do you need the most?
A. I need many things.
B. I can get a few of them right away, but might have to order some.
A. I can wait a few days for these items.
B. Make sure that you have money allocated for these supplies. How much do you 
have for office supplies?
A. I don't think we have very much money for supplies, but we have a little.
B. Would you like them delivered to you or can you come get them here?
A. I am not sure yet.
B. When you finish completing the request form, we will order and let you know 
when the supplies are here. Have a great day!
A. Good-bye!

A. I was wondering if you need any help on your new project.
B. Sure! That would be great! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the 
computer work?
A. I would like to help with the computer work.
B. Great! We are going to be working in teams of three. Are you OK working with 
others?
A. Yes, I like working like that.
B. We will begin next Monday. Would you be available then?
A. Yes, I can be there.
B. Well, if you could send me your basic background information before next 
Monday, it would be useful.
A. I will send the information to you.
B. Well then, thanks for your help. Have a great day!

A. Would you like me to help you on your new project?
B. I would love the help! Would you prefer helping with the writing part or is 
programming more your thing?
A. I would enjoy helping with the writing portion.
B. Perfect! You'll be working alone on that portion. Do you like to work alone?
A. That is OK sometimes.
B. Our first meeting is next Monday. Could you meet with us at that time?
A. No, I can't be there.
B. Please send me your background information before the meeting so I can look 
at it.
A. I can send that information to you.
B. OK. I look forward to working with you. Enjoy your week!

A. Could I help you on your new project?
B. I have a need for help with writing and also a need for help with the 
computer work. Which would you prefer?
A. I want to help with both.
B. That would be wonderful. Sometimes we will be working together and sometimes 
independently. Would that be OK?
A. Most of the time that is what I prefer.
B. We start on Monday. Can you be there?
A. I am not sure yet.
B. I need your background information before the meeting.
A. I will do that.
B. I'll enjoy working with you. Have a great day!

A. Can you help me plan the office party?
B. Sure. What do you need the most help with, the food or entertainment?
A. I need help with food.
B. OK, well, let's coordinate our efforts. Should this party be formal or casual?
A. I think it should be casual.
B. I agree. Next, we have to decide on food. We have a choice of Chinese or 
Continental Cuisine. Which one should we have?
A. I would prefer Chinese food for this party.
B. Perfect choice. For music, should we have a live band or a DJ?
A. I think we should hire a live band.
B. OK then. Well, I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on 
Friday.

A. I need help with the office party.
B. Yes, of course. We could split it. What part would you like to do, the food 
or the entertainment?
A. I have no idea what the entertainment should be.
B. Let's make sure we are on the same page. Do we want a formal or informal 
gathering?
A. Let's make it a formal affair.
B. Yes, that would be best. Now, for food should we have Chinese or American 
food?
A. American food would be the best choice.
B. That would be great. What kind of music would you like, a band or recorded 
music?
A. We should bring in a really good DJ.
B. That works for me. Let's see what we can each do about planning our part and 
meet again on Friday.

A. Would you help me figure out what to do about the office 
party?
B. I would be happy to help. What would you like me to help with, food or 
entertainment?
A. I would like to help you with both.
B. That will work out fine. To make sure everything goes together, do you think 
this party should be casual or dressy?
A. A dressy party would be fun!
B. That will work out fine. Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would 
be best?
A. We should probably have both.
B. Yes, that will work out fine. Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ?
A. Maybe we could do both!
B. Everything sounds great then! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss 
the details.

A. Is there anything I can help?
B. Yes, thank you. I am really far behind on this project. Could you help me 
with the extra typing or xeroxing?
A. I can do either one.
B. Good. That would be very helpful. Can you start with those pages over there?
A. No problem.
B. Thank you very much! How long have you been working here?
A. I have been working here for 5 years.
B. Well, we have some special projects coming up. Would you be interested in 
working on any of those?
A. Yes, I would love to work on a special project!
B. Well then, I'll keep you in the loop. Thank you for your help today.

A. Do you need any help?
B. I need some help catching up. Are you good at typing or could you help me 
xerox?
A. I like xeroxing.
B. Thank you! There are papers on the table to start with.
A. That would be OK.
B. I really appreciate the help. How many years have you been with the company?
A. I just started working here.
B. I have a special assignment coming up. Would you be interested in helping me 
on it?
A. I'd like to, but I am very busy.
B. I'll make sure that management keeps you in mind for special projects in the 
future. Thanks for the help!

A. What can I do to help you?
B. I have some extra help with my project. What would you prefer to help me 
with, typing or xeroxing?
A. I could do some typing for you.
B. That is very kind of you to offer to do that. Can you start with the pages on 
the table?
A. That would be a good place to start.
B. I like your positive attitude. How many years have you been employed here?
A. I have worked here long time.
B. We have a really interesting project coming up. Would you want to join us on 
it?
A. I'm not sure. Let me think about it.
B. OK. I will mention how great you were about helping me today. I appreciate 
your help.

A. Can you help me with my timesheet?
B. Sure! I can help you. Do you know where the timesheets are kept?
A. No, I don't know where to find one.
B. Well, once you get one off the shelf over there, you first put your name on 
it. OK?
A. Yes, I can do that.
B. Now you have to fill in the hours in the blanks and total the hours for the 
week. Do you know how to use military time?
A. No, I don't know what that is.
B. OK, so we just start counting hours at midnight and record it. Show all 
minutes as a dot and then write how many minutes. OK?
A. Yes, I understand how to do this.
B. After you total your hours, make sure you sign it and turn it in to your 
supervisor.
A. That was easy!
B. Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on.

A. How do we do timesheets here?
B. They are actually fairly straightforward. Do you know where the blanks are 
kept?
A. Yes, I already have one.
B. OK, well after you take one out of that second drawer, you put your name on 
the top. Do you see?
A. I am kind of confused.
B. Next you fill in all of your hours for each day and total them. Do you know 
how to show time on a 24-hour clock?
A. I'm not quite sure.
B. Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in, make sure that you show 
them with a dot followed by the minutes. Do you understand?
A. No, I have no idea what you are talking about.
B. It's easy, just write in the hours, total it, sign it, and put it in the box.
A. Thanks for your help.
B. Try it and if you can't do it, one of us can always help you later.

A. I need help with my timesheet.
B. OK, no problem. Have you found the blank ones?
A. Yes, I have seen them.
B. Yes, well put your name on it after you have downloaded it off the company 
website. OK?
A. Yes, I understand what to do.
B. You fill in the hours and total them for the week. Have you ever used a 24 
hour clock?
A. What? Huh?
B. So after you noted the hours, starting at zero which is midnight, you just 
write down the minutes as a dot followed by minutes. Get it?
A. Huh? What?
B. Just make sure you show your total, sign it, and turn it in.
A. I thought you said this was easy.
B. You are a quick learner. I don't think you'll have any trouble with this.

A. I need help figuring out how to use this phone.
B. Sure. First you pick up the receiver and hit one of the first 3 buttons. Do 
you hear a tone?
A. Yes, I hear the tone.
B. OK. Now you dial 9 on the keypad. Do you hear the tone change?
A. Yes, it changed.
B. Well, when you hear it change, that means you have an outside line. Where are 
you trying to call?
A. I am trying to call home.
B. OK. Well, to dial to the outside you just now dial the number. For a call 
inside the company just hit the extension number. Do you know the extensions?
A. Yes, I have a list of extensions.
B. Well, if you ever need help with an extension, you can dial O.

A. Can you show me how to use this phone?
B. Yes, I can help you with that. Pick up the receiver and hit one of the 
buttons. Do you hear a tone?
A. No, I don't hear anything.
B. Next you dial 9 on the keypad. You should hear the tone change. Did you hear 
it change?
A. I'm not sure.
B. OK. Well, after you get the line to change you have an outside line. Who are 
you trying to call?
A. I am trying to call a client.
B. To call a number on the outside you now just dial the number. For inside calls, punch 
in the extension number. Has someone given you an extension list?
A. No, I don't know anyone's extension.
B. All of the extensions are listed on the wall chart over there if you ever 
need help.

A. I want to make a phone call. Can you show me how?
B. Of course, pick up the receiver, hit a button and listen for a tone. Are you 
hearing it?
A. Yes, now what do I do?
B. Well, after you dial 9 on the keypad, you should hear the tone change.
A. No, nothing changed.
B. When you dial 9 and hear the tone change it means you have an outside line. 
Who are you trying to call?
A. I am trying to call my boss.
B. For an outside call you now just dial the number. For a company number you 
need to know the extension. Do you have a list of extensions?
A. I know a few extensions but I don't know all of them.
B. You can always look an extension up on the company website.

A. I would like to make an appointment for a project meeting.
B. Of course, I have Monday or Tuesday available. What day would be best for 
you?
A. I would like to meet on Monday.
B. Very well then. Are mornings or afternoons best?
A. I want to come in the morning.
B. I will have my assistant check my calendar and get back to you with the exact 
time. Can you bring me an outline of the project when you come?
A. Yes, I can bring the outline when I come to the meeting.
B. Do you think that we should include the entire committee in the meeting or 
just our sub-committee?
A. I think that we should have just the sub-committee.
B. OK then, I will make the arrangements for them to attend. Do you know how to 
get there?
A. No, I need directions, please.
B. Fine, we will make sure that we send you all of the information that you 
need. See you there!

A. Could I meet with you to discuss the project?
B. Good idea. We could meet on Monday or Tuesday. Which day would you prefer?
A. Tuesday would be good for me.
B. OK. Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon?
A. I think the afternoon would be best.
B. That will work out. I will e-mail the exact time tomorrow. I need you to 
bring your plans with you.
A. Yes, I will bring my plans with me to the meeting.
B. Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee 
there?
A. I feel that the whole committee needs to be there.
B. Yes, I agree. We'll make sure that they get notified. Can you find the 
meeting place?
A. Yes, I know how to get there on my own.
B. Great! We will send you all the details later. Looking forward to meeting 
with you!

A. When could we meet to discuss the project?
B. I will be available on Monday or Tuesday. Choose which day is best for you.
A. I prefer Monday.
B. Good. Can you come in the morning or would afternoon be best?
A. Either one is OK.
B. Great! When I check with the others, I will send you an exact time. When you 
come, be prepared to do your presentation.
A. I will be prepared to do my presentation.
B. Who would you like to see there? Just the sub-committee or should we ask the 
whole committee?
A. Everyone needs to be there.
B. That will probably be best. Do you need help with directions?
A. I think I know where it is. Maybe you could send me directions just to make 
sure.
B. OK. We will e-mail you all the information you need tomorrow. Have a good 
day!

A. I had an appointment tomorrow and I need to change it to a 
different date.
B. Certainly, what day would be best for you?
A. I think that Monday or Tuesday would be good for me.
B. I can give you Monday; I have ten or eleven in the morning.
A. I think ten o'clock is best.
B. Fine, I'll put you down for that.
A. That would be great!
B. Happy I could help you; see you then!

A. I was wondering if I could reschedule my appointment to a 
later date?
B. OK, just tell me what day would be best for your 
appointment.
A. Wednesday or Thursday would be perfect.
B. Thursday is available; would ten or eleven be best?
A. I would love to have an eleven o'clock appointment.
B. Great, I'll just add you in, if that works.
A. Perfect, I appreciate that.
B. So happy that we had an opening for you.

A. I can't make my appointment and need to make another one. 
B. That's OK, we can reschedule it if you tell me what day works for you.
A. Friday, Saturday, or Sunday would be good for me.
B. I can give you Friday; would you prefer ten or eleven? 
A. Ten o'clock is perfect.
B. Well, in that case, I'll just write you in.
A. Thanks. That will work out well.
B. It was my pleasure to have been able to make it work.

A. Excuse me for being late to work.
B. Where have you been?
A. My car broke down.
B. That's too bad. Please try to fix it so that it doesn't happen again.
A. Yes, I'll work on it.
B. Thank you, have a seat. We are working on the new project 
A. Great! Fill me in.
B. Let's take a look at the Campbell Project.
A. I don't understand the projected revenues.
B. Let's take another look at it for those of you who don't understand.

A. I am sorry I am so late to work.
B. What was the problem?
A. I lost track of time.
B. Things happen; make sure it doesn't become a habit.
A. It won't happen again.
B. All right, please take this message and call this client.
A. No problem.
B. Now does everyone understand the diagram on the board?
A. Yes, I understand the numbers.
B. I will explain it again; especially for those of you who arrived late.

A. I lost track of time, am I late?
B. Yes. What kept you from arriving on time?
A. My friend needed me to help him.
B. I realize that everyone has emergencies; just get here on time from now on.
A. My apologies.
B. I appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting.
A. Sure, I'll sit right here.
B. Wonderful, does anyone have any questions about this project?
A. I am confused about the projected revenues.
B. I'm glad that some of you get it, but let's go over it once more.

A. So tell me again, why couldn't you get the supplies I 
ordered?
B. Well I ordered them when you asked, but the supplier said they might 
need to back order them.
A. When do you think they will finally arrive?
B. I think maybe by Tuesday.
A. If they don't arrive by then, what are our options?
B. I could try another supplier down the street.
A. That would work for me.
B. OK, I will stay on it and let you know how it's going.
A. Thank you for taking care of the problem.
B. Thank you for your business. We appreciate you as a client.

A. You promised me the supplies would be in today and now you 
say they aren't here?
B. They said they had part of the order, but the rest won't be available until 
later.
A. I guess that's it then, when will you be able to get the rest?
B. I am not sure.
A. I am not convinced that will work for me, what now?
B. I could order them from another supplier as a back-up.
A. That is a good plan.
B. Good! I will call you later this afternoon and let you know when your 
supplies will arrive.
A. I appreciate you staying on it.
B. We appreciate your business and aim to please.

A. I really needed the supplies today and you are telling me you 
don't have them?
B. The supplier said that it will be a few more days until they can ship the 
order.
A. Fine, what day will the whole order be here?
B. If we are lucky, they may get here tomorrow.
A. Is there anywhere else we can get these supplies?
B. Let's order the missing items from someone else just to be sure.
A. I appreciate that suggestion.
B. I will track your order on the internet and e-mail you the moment it arrives.
A. I look forward to hearing from you.
B. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do for you in the 
meantime.

A. What does she look like?
B. Well, she was pretty tall, about 5 feet 10 inches and kind of scary looking!
A. What do you mean, scary?
B. Well, she had a crazy sounding laugh and wild hair. Do you know what I mean?
A. Yes, I know what you mean.
B. And her piercing eyes! She looked like an alien who just came down from outer 
space. Do you believe that people from outer space live amongst us?
A. No, that's impossible!
B. Unless they beam us up for a ride, we will never know for sure. Have you ever 
thought that you saw a flying saucer?
A. Are you crazy?
B. Hah, I guess we never know what can happen. Do you like Star Wars movies?
A. Yes, I have seen all of the Star Wars movies.
B. I loved Star Wars movies. My favorite character was Yoda. What about you?
A. I liked Darth Vader.
B. Yeah, that character was pretty cool. If you had to describe that character, 
what would you say about them?
A. They were very beautiful.
B. Yeah, I know what you mean!

A. Can you describe her for me?
B. She was large, hairy, and scary!
A. What are you talking about?
B. When she laughed, it sent chills up my spine. Have you ever met someone like 
that?
A. Yes, one time I met someone like that.
B. She had eyes like laser beams. Sometimes I wonder if aliens from UFOs live 
here with us. Do you think that's possible?
A. Sure, I think it could happen.
B. I guess it's impossible to say for sure unless you go for a ride in one. Do 
you think that would be an interesting experience?
A. No, I never want to be near a UFO!
B. Well, you will probably never see one. Have you seen any Star Wars movies?
A. No, I haven't seen any Star Wars movies.
B. Star Wars was the best. I really like Darth Vader. Do you have a favorite 
character?
A. I like Luke Skywalker.
B. Oh yeah, I forgot about that character! What words do you think would best 
describe that character?
A. He looked like a black vacuum cleaner.
B. I totally agree!

A. How does she look?
B. I am not sure how tall she was but she was very scary!
A. Is this a joke?
B. Oh my god, you should have seen her! She looked like she had just crawled out 
from underneath something. Do you get what I am saying?
A. No, I have no idea what you are talking about.
B. Oh man, her eyes were the most incredible glowing green. She might be a 
Martian or something. Do you think that is possible?
A. Yes, I believe in UFOs.
B. I've never seen a UFO but I would like to. How about you?
A. Yes, I think that seeing a UFO would be fascinating.
B. Personally, I've never seen one. I think is would be fun to see the universe 
like in a Star Wars movie. Have you seen the Star Wars movies?
A. I saw some of them.
B. I loved the special effects and the story. I like Princess Leah. Who did you 
like the best?
A. I like Yoda.
B. Yes, that is a good choice. How would you describe that character if you had 
to tell someone what they looked like?
A. He was hot!
B. That's a really good description.

A. I was wondering if I could borrow the company van for a 
fundraiser this weekend.
B. Sure, I think that would be possible. Where is the fundraiser?
A. It is in the park downtown.
B. Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday?
A. We will need it for Saturday only.
B. I think that would be OK. Who will be driving it?
A. Mary and I will be driving the van.
B. Could you drop it off on Sunday night?
A. Yes, we can do that. Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also?
B. Yes, that would be fine. Just make sure that everything is returned by Sunday 
night.

A. Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and 
would like to borrow the van, if possible.
B. I would need to check on that. Where is the fundraiser?
A. It will be at the beach by the pier.
B. What day will you need it for?
A. We will only be needing it for Sunday.
B. Maybe that could work. I need to know who will be driving it.
A. The only two drivers will be Mary and I.
B. If I give you the keys to the garage, could you bring it back on Sunday 
evening?
A. Sure. We also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom. Would that be 
OK?
B. OK, but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest.

A. Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this 
weekend?
B. That would be a possibility. Where is this fundraiser taking place?
A. It is in the hotel ballroom down the street.
B. Do you need it for the whole weekend?
A. We will need it for both days.
B. We will need to know who will be driving the van.
A. The van will be driven by Mary and me.
B. It needs to be back on Sunday night. Can you arrange for that?
A. Yes, no problem. Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from 
the lunchroom?
B. Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by 
Sunday evening.

A. I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the 
mountains.
B. I agree, I think that that would be perfect!
A. I was thinking it could take place sometime in January.
B. That might be a little too cold for some people.
A. Yes, you are right.
B. What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot.
A. Yes, that would work out better.
B. You know, maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone.
A. Good idea! We'll have to get right on it.
B. Fine! Well, I'll get right on it now!

A. I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains 
this year.
B. What a great idea!
A. January would be a good month for a mountain retreat.
B. I like the mountain idea, but I am not so sure about the month of January.
A. You know, now that I think about it, you might be right.
B. April might be nice. It is far enough away to make the necessary 
arrangements.
A. That is a good suggestion.
B. We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them.
A. Yes, that would let us know what would work best.
B. I'll put the survey online this afternoon.

A. The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat.
B. That's a wonderful choice.
A. I have chosen January as the month for this retreat.
B. January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays.
A. Yes, maybe another choice might be better.
B. I think that April would work. Spring is a lovely time to be in the 
mountains.
A. Thank you for thinking of that.
B. Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer.
A. That is a good idea.
B. I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers.

A. I was thinking about applying for the new position.
B. Do you think that is a good idea?
A. It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure.
B. What are your main concerns?
A. It would give me a chance to grow, but I am wondering if I would like 
the job.
B. I know what you mean, I've thought about that myself.
A. I also am thinking about the pay.

for the new job.

A. I am also wondering about the pay.
B. Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth?

mind.

yesterday.

boring for me.

better.

A. I am calling to find out why I didn't receive an unemployment check this 
    week.
B. Did you send in your Continued Claim Form for the last period?

B. You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you 
    want to get paid.

A. Will my paycheck come right away now?
B. Your check will arrive a little late.

A. Could you help me figure out why I am missing my unemployment check for 
    this week?
B. I hope that you remembered to send in your last Continued Claim Form.

    what to pay you.
A. Can I mail it in late?
B. If it is not more than fourteen days past its due date, then you may 
    still mail it in.
A. I think that I will mail it in right away when I get it next time, so I 
    won't be late.
B. You can't mail it in early because you don't know, in advance, how much 
    you will be working.
A. Even though I was late turning in my form, will my paycheck be late?
B. Yes, your check will be a little late in getting to you.

A. I didn't receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why.

A. I am afraid that I forgot to send it in.
B. We cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks.
A. Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now?
B. It can't be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it.
A. I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem.
B. You can't possibly know in advance how much you will be working. If you 
    mail it in too soon, we will reject it!
A. Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form?
B. Your check will be arriving late, but the next one will come right on 
    time.

A. Is there someone I can talk to about a payment question?
B. Yes, we can handle that here. How can I help you?
A. My paycheck that just arrived is less than last week's check.
B. Did you work at all during the last pay period?
A. Yes, actually, I did make a little bit of money.
B. Did you report it on your Continued Claim Form? 
A. Yes, I showed that income on the Continued Claim Form.
B. Well, we deducted a portion of the income that you made from this week's 
    check.
A. Maybe I just shouldn't show the income then.
B. That is cheating and, if you get caught, you will be fined and 
    disqualified from collecting unemployment.

A. I have a question about my payment and need someone to help me.
B. Yes, I would be happy to answer a question about payment. What do you 
    need help with?
A. I can't figure out why my paycheck this week is smaller than last week's.
B. Did you generate any income during that time period?
A. I made a little bit of money, but not much.
B. Did that income show up on your last Continued Claim Form?
A. I claimed the work I did on the last Continued Claim Form.
B. When you are able to find work and get paid, we always take away part of 
    your check.
A. That being the case, I don't think that I am going to show the income 
    next time.
B. Don't do it! If you get caught making false statements, you can have your 
    claim closed.

A. I was wondering if someone in your office could help me with a question I 
    have about my payment.
B. I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.
A. My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week.
B. What about income? Did you make any money during that period?
A. My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period.
B. When you filled out your Continued Claim Form, did you show that income?
A. Of course I wrote down the work that I had done on the Continued Claim 
    Form.
B. What happens is, when you make money, we take part of your benefits away.
A. I am not going to show any income from now on then.
B. I wouldn't do that if I were you. There is a severe penalty if you get 
    caught making false statements.

A. I was wondering if you could go over the services available at EDD to 
    help me get a job.

    placement service that you can make use of.

    Internet-based placement service that you can use.

A. Believe it or not, the company I worked for closed down, so I'm out of a 
    job.
B. The same with me. Have you given much thought to what you want to do 
    next?
A. I am not being all that particular right now because I just need to keep 
    a roof over my head.
B. How about interviews? Have you been on any of those yet?

B. It's easy. Don't worry about it.
A. What's the most important part?
B. Well, the most important thing we need to do is make sure that our name 
    and contact information are across the top.
A. What comes next?
B. You can either list your job experience next or your education--whichever 
    is the most impressive should be first.
A. Can I list my interests next?
B. Sure, that would be a good place for them.

    held.

A. It's been a long time since I've had to look for work and put a resume 
    together.

A. Where do we begin?
B. We start at the top with our name and contact information. Make sure the 
    information is current.
A. Then what do we do?
B. Put your job experience first, if that is more impressive than your 
    education.
A. What about listing my interests and affiliations next?
B. Yes, that would make a good ending for your resume.

B. You came to the right spot. Come on in and join us!

B. I am here to show you how to put together the perfect resume. It will 
    turn out great!
A. How do we get started?
B. We need to put our name and contact information across the top.
A. Then what?
B. You can list your education at the top, or choose your job experience to 
    be there if it is more impressive.
A. Could I list my interests and special skills next?
B. I think that that would work out quite well as an ending for your resume.

A. Is this the class to prepare for interviews?
B. This is the right place. Please join us.
A. I have an interview tomorrow, so I hope I can learn everything quickly.
B. We are all going to have great interviews. What are some things that we 
    need to remember in an interview?
A. I think that we should make sure that our looks are the best they can be.
B. Right, and what about our friendliness and attitude?
A. Yes, and being friendly and having a good attitude also help me relax.
B. Did you know that they pay as much attention to what you ask as to what 
    you say in an interview?
A. No, I didn't. What else should I keep in mind?
B. Just relax, listen carefully to the questions, and be honest in your 
    responses.

A. Is this the workshop to prepare for an interview?
B. This is the interview class. Welcome to our class.
A. I am really excited to be taking this workshop so that I can get ready 
    for my interview next week.
B. We are all learning things that will help us in our interview. What do 
    you think are some important considerations going into your interview?
A. I think that we should dress neatly and appropriately.
B. Yes. Second, as you can imagine, attitude and friendliness go a long way.
A. Yes, and I always feel much better when I am friendly.
B. Believe it or not, the interviewers are as interested in your questions 
    as they are in your answers.
A. Any more hints as to what I should do in an interview?
B. Always be honest with your answers. The interviewers really do want to 
    know if you will be a good fit for them.

A. I was trying to find the class on preparing for interviews.
B. You have found your way to the interview class. Please come in!
A. I am so happy I found this class because I was really nervous about my 
    upcoming interview.
B. When we go into an interview, what do you think our first consideration 
    should be?
A. Our dress and grooming are probably the first thing an interviewer judges 
    us by.
B. Friendliness and a good attitude are also very important.
A. Yes, and they help establish a friendly tone for the rest of the 
    interview.
B. The interviewers always are interested in what you ask them about their 
    company.
A. What else should I be thinking about?
B. Be yourself and be honest. Simply answer the questions put to you.

A. What should I do when I find a job?
B. There are a few considerations. Is this a part-time or full-time job?
A. Does it make a difference?
B. Basically, you really don't need to do much of anything. On the Continued 
    Claim Form, you will note that you now have a new job and also note what you 
    are earning.
A. If I get work for a few weeks, will I be terminated from EDD?
B. You will not mess up your job benefits by taking work. You can always 
    come back and notify EDD that you are once again in need of assistance.

A. Should I tell EDD that I have found a job?
B. Is this a temporary job or something more permanent?
A. What difference does it make?
B. When you get your next Continued Claim Form, you should just write down 
    where you worked and note that you no longer need unemployment.
A. If I take a short job and then get laid off, will I be starting over 
    trying to get unemployment?
B. Just because you work for a week doesn't mean that you will be losing 
    your benefits.

A. How do I know when to tell EDD that have I started a new job?
B. Work is work, whether it's a part-time or temporary job or a full-time 
    gig.
A. So I guess I have to report that I've found a little bit of work.
B. All you need to do is fill in the blanks correctly on the Continued Claim 
    Form, and the EDD Office will take care of the rest.
A. What about if I find a job that I know will only last for a couple of 
    weeks? Can I take it?
B. It is to your advantage to work as much as you can.

A. I need help planning my vacation.
B. Sure, where would you like to go?
A. I haven't decided where to go yet.
B. Do you enjoy warm or cold climates?
A. I am thinking that I might enjoy a tropical climate.
B. I have some brochures here that you might like to look at.
A. These look great!
B. Do you know how much you want to spend on this vacation?
A. I have about a thousand dollars to spend on this trip.
B. Well, take these brochures, and get back to me when you want to make your 
    reservations.

A. Could you help me with vacation plans?
B. Do you know where you will be traveling?

    somewhere with a cooler climate?

    I'll be happy to help you make a reservation.

A. I was wondering if you would be able to help me with vacation plans.
B. Have you chosen your destination?
A. I don't know where I want to go yet.
B. Do you enjoy warm weather, or are you looking forward to a cooler

    sign?
B. The pilot needs to make sure that there is no more turbulence before he 
    lets us get up.
A. Do you think that we are going to die?
B. Can I buy you an alcoholic beverage?

A. I can't believe how bad the weather is today!
B. Yes, according to the weather report, we will be flying through a pretty 
    nasty storm.
A. I don't really like flying in this kind of weather.
B. It is normal to feel a little nervous about flying in bad weather.
A. How long do you think this will last?
B. Usually the pilot can get enough altitude to get above it. I hope that 
    happens this time!
A. What if one of the engines stops working?
B. I trust that the airline wouldn't let us take off without feeling that 
    all was okay.
A. How much longer do you think that the pilot will leave the Fasten Your 
    Seatbelt sign on?
B. When we are past the turbulence, I am sure that the pilot will shut the 
    light off.
A. Do you think we are headed for an air disaster?
B. Would you like a pillow and blanket so you can take a nap?

A. I was wondering if I could order something to drink.

A. How much do drinks cost?
B. Our alcoholic beverages are five dollars each. All others are 
    complimentary.

    hours into our flight.
A. What are our dinner choices?
B. You will have a choice of chicken, fish, or beef. I will be bringing a 
    menu by shortly.
A. I am a vegetarian and need a vegetarian meal.
B. Vegetarian meals need to be requested at least two days before your 
    flight. I might be able to find you extra servings of vegetables, however.

A. I am getting thirsty and was wondering if I may order a drink.
B. Yes, I would be happy to take your drink order. We have coffee, tea, or 
    soda as well as bar drinks.

    each.

    chance to look at a menu a little before our mealtime.
A. Do you have vegetarian meals?
B. We serve many different meals for people with religious or dietary 
    restrictions. We do need to know about this at the time you book your 
    flight.

A. When you get a chance, could you take my drink order, please?
B. On this flight you may have your choice of bar drinks or coffee, tea, or 
    soft drinks.

B. Our alcoholic beverages are five dollars apiece. All others are two 
    dollars each with free refills.

    dinner in a few hours.
A. What are we having for dinner tonight?
B. We are serving a chicken, fish, or beef plate. You may select whatever 
    you choose. 
A. Can I order a vegetarian plate?
B. With advance notice, we are able to accommodate a wide variety of special 
    diet needs. Once we are in the air, unfortunately, there isn't much we can 
    do.

A. My flight just arrived late, and I need to know what to do.
B. That's okay. The airline computer is keeping track of what is happening 
    with you.
A. Do I have to call anyone?
B. By speaking with us at the arrival gate, we can fix the problem for you 
    and direct you.
A. What if there are no more connecting flights for today on this airline?
B. We will go online to see if there is something available with this 
    airline. If we need to, we can check for a flight with another carrier.
A. What if I can't find another flight out of here tonight?
B. We can help you find transportation to a local hotel.
A. Will the airline pay for my room if I have to spend the night at the 
    airport?
B. Since the flight delay was our fault and you are continuing on with our 
    airline, we will cover the cost of a hotel room.

A. Our flight was late, and I missed my connecting flight.
B. We can help you find an alternate flight that will get you where you are 
    going.
A. Whom should I call?
B. The arrival gate is where you need to find someone to help you. You are 
    in the right place.
A. I think the flight we missed was the last flight out of here today.
B. We can go on the computer to try to find an alternate flight on another 
    airline if we cannot accommodate you.
A. What if I get stuck here and can't get out of this airport?
B. There is a shuttle that is still running and can take you into town to a 
    hotel.
A. I don't have any money for a hotel room.
B. The flight that you missed is not with our airline, and we would not have 
    suggested booking the flights so close together. We won't pay for your hotel 
    room.

A. I had a connecting flight, but our arriving flight was late.
B. We will help you make alternative plans.
A. Can you give me the number of the airline so that I can call?
B. The airlines always have personnel at the arrival gate to help direct you 
    when a flight is late. We can help you right here.
A. I remember that when we booked this flight, our connecting flight was the 
    only one on this day.
B. Our ticketing is tied in with other airlines. If we cannot accommodate 
    you, perhaps another airline has some open seats to your destination.
A. Where will I stay if I can't get another flight tonight?
B. Since I believe there is a flight out of here at 5:45 in the morning, you 
    may want to consider just staying at the airport.
A. I don't think I should have to pay for a hotel room.
B. We will pay 50 percent of the price of your room.

A. I just arrived and need help getting transportation to my hotel.
B. There are shuttles, taxis, and buses that go all over the city.
A. Which one is the best form of transportation?
B. It depends on where you want to go. If you are going to a well-known 
    hotel, they have their own shuttles that drop you right off at the door.
A. Where can I catch a cab?
B. All ground transportation leaves from the island as you walk out the 
    arrivals gate.
A. Where can I rent a car?
B. The car rental agencies are against the wall as you exit.
A. Are there any subways in this town?
B. We have a subway system, but you need to take a shuttle to get to the 
    station.

A. I need help figuring out how to get to my friend's house in the city.
B. You may take a shuttle, a taxi, or a bus to get wherever you need to go.
A. Which form of transportation is preferable?
B. It depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking to travel 
    inexpensively, a bus might be your best bet.
A. Where do the buses pick you up?
B. The ground transportation center is right outside the exit leading to the 
    street.
A. Is there a car rental place around here?
B. You can find a car rental agency just outside of baggage claim.
A. Is there a subway in this city?
B. Our subway station is a mile outside of the airport. I would suggest you 
    take the designated shuttle to get there.

A. I need information about my options for ground transportation.
B. This city has many taxis, shuttles, or buses to transport you to your 
    destination.
A. Is one form of transportation better than another?
B. It depends on where you are traveling. If your destination is close by, 
    you might want to just grab a taxicab.
A. Where are the shuttle pick-up points?
B. When you pick up your luggage, walk out of the door and you will see the 
    transportation kiosk.
A. Where are the car rental agencies?
B. You will see the car rental agencies as you walk down the hallway as you 
    exit.
A. I heard that you have a very good light rail system in this city.
B. We have a subway station in the airport. The in-airport moving sidewalk 
    system will take you to it.

A. I was wondering if you could help me book a few tours.
B. You have come to the right place. How many days will you be visiting 
    here?
A. I will be here for a week.
B. Have you ever visited our city before?
A. This is my first time visiting this city.
B. What are you interested in? Do you enjoy museums and buildings, or would 
    you rather hit some outdoor hotspots and venues?
A. I really enjoy visiting museums and art galleries.
B. We have tours for all interests.
A. Do you have a city tour?
B. Yes, in fact, I usually suggest that to visitors.

A. I need help knowing how to book some tours.
B. We will be able to book your tours here. How long will you be here?
A. I am only staying for three days.
B. Is this your first stay in our city?
A. I have been here before on a business trip but didn't really have a 
    chance to see much.
B. Have you thought of what types of things you would like to see? Would you 
    maybe like to visit some outdoor venues or nighttime hotspots?
A. I love being outdoors and would love to spend some time at the beach.
B. We have a tour that can take you where you can see all of that.
A. Do you have a tour where I can get a quick overview of the city?
B. We do have tours like that, and I think that that is a good place to 
    start.

A. I need help figuring out what to see and visit in this city.
B. We are definitely the place to come to when booking tours. What is the 
    length of your stay here?
A. I am on a layover and will only have today and tomorrow morning to 
    sightsee.
B. How familiar are you with our city?
A. Actually I was born here but haven't been here in twenty years.
B. Do you have any ideas of what you would like to see? Perhaps you would 
    enjoy our world-renowned museums or a visit to our magnificent zoological 
    gardens.
A. I was interested in checking out local architecture.
B. I think that you would enjoy a number of our tours.
A. Is there any way that I can take a quick tour of the city, so that I can 
    get some idea as to what I might like to see?
B. A general city tour is an excellent tour to start with.

A. I am having some big problems on this tour.
B. What seems to be the problem? We are here to help you.
A. This tour company seems very disorganized. No one seems to have a clear 
    picture as to where we are going and when we are going to get there.
B. I will see what I can do about that. How about the accommodations on the 
    tour?
A. So far, we have been staying in really out-of-the-way accommodations.
B. Is anything wrong with your room?
A. The television in our room was broken, and they didn't send anyone to fix 
    it.
B. I will complain to the hotel manager about that. How about the hotel 
    restaurant?
A. The food in the restaurant was terrible, and a few people from our group 
    got sick.
B. I am so sorry that you had such a bad experience. We would like to offer 
    you a free city tour and lunch to make it up to you.

A. I paid good money for this tour and would appreciate some help with some 
    problems that have come up.
B. I would like to help you smooth out any difficulties you are having. What 
    can I help you with?
A. This tour company can't seem to coordinate anything. We are always 
    arriving after something is closed or get there when the guides for the site 
    are on a break.
B. We are trying to fix that. Are the accommodations to your liking?
A. Our accommodations are pretty substandard.
B. Is there anything in particular that is wrong with your room?
A. The room smelled of smoke, even though it was supposed to be a nonsmoking 
    room.
B. You should not have to put up with that. Was the hotel restaurant good?
A. Actually a few people from our group got sick, and everyone thinks it was 
    from the bad dinner that we ate.
B. Our tour company takes pride in providing excellent tours. Please let me 
    offer you a free city tour and lunch as an apology.

A. I would like to discuss some problems that I am having with this tour.
B. I am sorry you are having a difficult time. What may I help you with?
A. This tour company doesn't seem to know the town very well. We are always 
    getting lost!
B. I am sorry that that has been the case. How would you rate your 
    accommodations?
A. Our accommodations are not very pleasant.
B. What don't you like about your room?
A. The room was very noisy, and we couldn't get to sleep.
B. That is unacceptable. Did you at least enjoy your dinner in the hotel 
    restaurant?
A. The food was horrible at the hotel restaurant, and a few of us got sick 
    after eating there.
B. I am glad that you told me about the problems. I would like you to be my 
    guest for a free massage at the hotel spa tonight.

A. Where should we go sightseeing today?
B. I think that some things might be best done in the morning and others in 
    the afternoon.
A. I think that I would like to go to the beach this morning.
B. That would be a good place to start our sightseeing. We could have 
    breakfast there.
A. I hear that there is a very nice natural history museum there.
B. Yes, it would be nice to check that out since we are so close by.
A. Where should we go in the afternoon?
B. I think that I would like to go to the amusement park. It's supposed to 
    be quite good.
A. At the end of the day, I would love to take in the sunset at the 
    restaurant by the park.
B. That sounds like a great idea! Let's go get a map.

A. It's so hard to choose where to go first on our sightseeing trip!
B. We could think of what would make a good morning activity versus an 
    evening activity.
A. I really wanted to make sure that I got a chance to go to the local 
    beach.
B. I think that that would be a fun beginning to our day. We could walk 
    around there.
A. I heard that the Natural History Museum is pretty close to the beach.
B. I heard the same thing. We might as well go there since we are just down 
    the street.
A. What would be a good place to go to in the afternoon?
B. The local amusement park is supposed to be wonderful.
A. The restaurant on the edge of the park would be a great place to watch 
    the sun go down.
B. That sounds like a perfect sightseeing day to me.

A. There are so many places to go on our sightseeing trip that I am having 
    trouble narrowing it down.
B. Let's figure out what to do before lunch and later figure out what to do 
    in the afternoon.
A. I heard that the local beach is a place that can't be missed.
B. That would be a relaxing way to begin our morning. It would be good to 
    get out in the sun.
A. The Natural History Museum is close by, isn't it?
B. That museum is supposed to be fantastic!
A. Do you have any suggestions as to where we could go in the afternoon?
B. We could check out the local amusement park.
A. We could eat dinner and watch the sun go down at that restaurant by the 
    park.
B. That could really end up being a great day!

A. I guess that we won't be going rollerblading today with all this rain!
B. Yes, rollerblading in six inches of water would not be fun. What would 
    you like to do instead?
A. I think that maybe we could check out the local mall, grab some lunch, 
    and maybe see a movie.
B. Yes, that sounds like a relaxing way to check out the local culture and 
    still stay dry.
A. What else could we do in bad weather?
B. You know, we could take a double-decker bus tour of famous haunted houses 
    and buildings.
A. That would be fun, and the rain would only add to the atmosphere.
B. There is an old English pub next door. Maybe when we finish with the 
    haunted house, we can duck in there for some brew.
A. What a great idea!
B. If we are lucky, maybe they'll have some great food at the pub for 
    supper.

A. This rain sort of blows our chances of going rollerblading!
B. No, I don't think that we will be able to do what we planned to do. What 
    can we do for fun today?
A. There is a large indoor mall just down the street with an incredible ice 
    rink we could check out.
B. We could stay inside and dry, and still get out of this hotel room for a 
    while.
A. I am trying to think of something else that we could do in bad weather.
B. We could sign up for that double-decker bus tour of haunted houses.
A. The rainy day would only add to the haunted house atmosphere.
B. I think that when we are done with our haunted house touring, we should 
    pop into the English pub next door for a beer.
A. I could go for that!
B. I hope that we can get some nice hot food for dinner at the pub.

A. I think that rollerblading today is kind of not happening in this 
    rainstorm.
B. We definitely need to come up with a different plan to amuse ourselves. 
    What do you think would be fun?
A. There is a large indoor mall hooked onto the Modern Art Museum just down 
    the street.
B. That would allow us to stay dry and still get a feel for the local 
    culture.
A. I wonder what the locals do in bad weather.
B. There is a sign for a double-decker tour of haunted houses in the lobby.
A. Haunted houses would be a perfect outing for a rainy day!
B. I think we should wrap up our rainy haunted house day with some ale at 
    the English pub down the street.
A. I think that rainy days and pubs go together!
B. Usually pubs have some pretty good cold-weather food. Maybe we can have 
    dinner there.

A. I want to look at the souvenirs over at the souvenir stand.
B. What do you need to buy?
A. I usually buy myself some jewelry or some clothing.
B. I always buy a lot of things for my family. How about you?
A. Yes, they practically swarm me when I get home!
B. What are some of their favorite gifts?
A. The teenagers like me to bring them tee shirts that you can't get 
    anywhere else.
B. This stuff is pretty expensive, isn't it?
A. Souvenirs cost a lot for what they are, but we can shop around for better 
    prices.
B. Let's go across the street and see what they have over there.

A. Let's stop and look at the souvenirs at the souvenir stand.
B. What types of souvenirs were you looking for?
A. When I travel, I usually like to bring back a special necklace or 
    clothing.
B. I end up buying a lot of stuff for the kids in my family. Do you like to 
    do that, too?
A. My family loves for me to take trips so they can get the goodies I bring 
    them.
B. What types of things do they like?
A. The little kids like little trinkets, like those little shell animals 
    over there.
B. I feel like this stuff is kind of overpriced.
A. Some souvenir stands charge more than others, so it pays to shop around.
B. Why don't we try checking prices a little farther away from the tourist 
    section?

A. We need to stop so I can shop for some souvenirs at the souvenir stand.
B. Do you have anything in particular that you are looking for?
A. I love to go clothes-shopping when I travel or buy a new piece of 
    jewelry.
B. The kids in my family love getting souvenirs. How about the children in 
    your family?
A. Everyone in my family enjoys getting treats from my travels!
B. What do they like you to bring home?
A. My nieces love to get little jewelry boxes like those on the top shelf.
B. Things seem to cost a lot at this stand.
A. You really need to shop around with souvenirs because they can vary a lot 
    in price.
B. We could walk a few more blocks away from the beach and see what the 
    prices are like there.

A. I am really not feeling very well.
B. Do you think you need to go to a doctor?
A. I think that we should maybe check into how to find a doctor in this 
    country.
B. I don't know where to begin looking for a doctor here.
A. I think that we should call the front desk to see if they can help us.
B. I have an American Express card. I heard that their travel services are 
    quite good.
A. That sounds like a great idea!
B. Do you have travel insurance?
A. Yes, I bought travel health insurance.
B. I am going to call down to the office right now and see what they can do 
    for us.

A. I haven't felt well since we ate dinner at that restaurant with the fish 
    on the menu.
B. Should I look into finding a doctor for you?
A. I feel bad enough that I am thinking about how we could find a doctor.
B. How does someone find a physician in this country?
A. The front desk should be able to find a doctor on call for us.
B. With my American Express card, we could probably get a good referral for 
    a doctor.
A. Yes, the card should help us find a good doctor.
B. Did you buy supplemental health insurance for travelers?
A. Yes, I am insured by a supplemental policy.
B. I will call American Express right now, and we'll get you some medical 
    advice.

A. I think I am running a fever, and my stomach hurts.
B. Do you feel bad enough that we should call a doctor?
A. I don't want to wait till the last minute to try and locate a physician.
B. Do you know how to find a doctor in this country?
A. The front desk would probably be our best source for a doctor.
B. I am going to call the travel services number on my American Express card 
    to get a referral.
A. I am sure that they could refer us to a good doctor.
B. Are you insured by a traveler's insurance policy?
A. No, but I checked before I left, and my home health policy covers me 
    here.
B. I will call the insurance company and see what doctor they want us to 
    use.

A. I can't find my purse!
B. What was in your purse?
A. It contained my wallet and passport.
B. How much money was in your wallet?
A. There was about $200 in my wallet, and I had some traveler's checks in 
    there, too.
B. We can call American Express to deal with the traveler's checks. How 
    about credit cards?
A. I had a MasterCard and a Visa Card.
B. We can look at the back of my cards to get the emergency phone numbers.
A. Where do I report that my passport is missing?
B. We need to take a cab to the embassy to report that right away. They will 
    help us.

A. I think that someone stole my purse!
B. What did you have in your purse?
A. Both my wallet and my passport were in there.
B. Did you have a lot of money in your wallet?
A. Fortunately there was only a little change and some traveler's checks.
B. Did you have any credit cards in your wallet? We need to report them as 
    well as the traveler's checks.
A. I only had a Visa Card in my wallet.
B. We can call the front desk to get the lost or stolen card phone numbers.
A. I am worried about reporting my passport as missing.
B. The embassy can help us. We should walk over there and they can advise us 
    on what we can do about replacing your passport.

A. I left my purse in the taxi!
B. Can you remember what you had in your purse?
A. I had my wallet and my passport in that purse.
B. How much cash was in your wallet?
A. Most of my money was in traveler's checks with just a little amount in 
    cash.

    report those as well as your traveler's checks.
A. I had an American Express Card and a Visa Card in my wallet.
B. We can call the information number to get the phone numbers for lost or 
    stolen cards.
A. Do you know how to report a missing passport?
B. We need to contact the embassy right away. They will be able to help you 
    replace your passport.

A. Is there anything special I need to think about as I tour this city?
B. You need to keep in mind that this is a very poor country. Things are a 
    little more desperate here than you are used to.
A. What do I need to look for?
B. Be particularly vigilant anytime you are in a crowded place with other 
    tourists. Pickpockets know that tourists aren't paying all that much 
    attention.
A. I have seen many children on the street begging, so what do I do about 
    them?
B. It is best not to give money to children or other beggars on the street, 
    as they can swarm you. You can give money to a local charity.
A. Should I be concerned about what I eat or drink?
B. Do not drink any water that isn't bottled. Avoid street vendor food.
A. How about being out on the street at night?
B. I would take a cab to your destination at night. Don't walk down the 
    street alone.

A. This city is much larger than the one I live in, and I wonder if there is 
    anything special that I need to keep in mind.
B. Crime can happen anywhere, but it is a little worse here because of the 
    poverty.
A. Should I be vigilant about anything in particular?
B. The train stations, airports, and tourist sites are favorite spots for 
    pickpockets.
A. When I see children on the street begging, what amount should I give 
    them?
B. I wouldn't suggest giving money to them. Most of them are put out there 
    by adults who then take their money.
A. Can I eat or drink anything I want to?
B. Do not use tap water at all, not even to brush your teeth. Only eat fruit 
    that has been peeled.
A. Can I walk around and see the sights at night?
B. I would be sure to travel in a group at night. Stay in well-lit areas.

A. Do I need to take any special safety precautions in this city?
B. This is a very large city with a lot of crowds to work your way through. 
    Keep in mind that poverty makes people a little more desperate.
A. What should I watch out for?
B. You have to pay special attention at train stations, airports, and 
    tourist sites. They are known for having a lot of pickpockets.
A. There are so many children begging on the street that I don't know which 
    ones to give money to.
B. It is a natural instinct to want to give money to those children, but it 
    is better to give money to one of the local charities or schools.
A. Are the local food and drink safe?
B. Avoid eating food prepared by street vendors. Use only bottled water.
A. How safe is it to be out at night?
B. You should always travel with others at night and stick to well-lit 
    areas.

A. This is really a fascinating city!
B. Yes, this city is thousands of years old and has quite a history!
A. I really love this temple we are visiting.
B. As you enter the temple, please remove your shoes as the others are 
    doing.
A. It is so quiet here.
B. Yes, they are showing respect to their gods. People come here to pray and 
    meditate.
A. I noticed that the women all have some sort of head covering.
B. It is a tradition that women cover their heads while in the temple.
A. I noticed that all of the people were eating with their hands at dinner 
    last night.
B. Yes, that is another custom that people practice here.

A. I have never traveled to a place that was so different from my home.
B. Yes, this city has a fascinating and diverse past. It is thousands of 
    years old!
A. This temple is beautiful!
B. Please make sure that you remove your shoes before you enter the temple.
A. It is very quiet in here even though there are a lot of people in this 
    area.
B. Yes, even the children are expected to be respectful and quiet here. 
    People need quiet to meditate.
A. The women all seem to have beautiful scarves or veils on their heads.
B. Women in this society would not consider setting foot in a temple without 
    their head being covered.
A. I noticed at dinner last night that people in this country like to use 
    their bread to eat with instead of silverware.
B. Yes, that bread is made of a special texture that works well for that.

A. This city is certainly very different from what I am used to at home.
B. This is an amazing city. It is quite ancient with a diverse past!
A. What an amazing temple!
B. See how everyone is removing their shoes before entering? We need to do 
    the same.
A. The people in this room are very quiet.
B. This is an area of peace and tranquility. It is expected that people keep 
    their voices down out of respect for those who are meditating.
A. The women's scarves are quite beautiful.
B. Women of this faith must have their heads covered to enter the temple.
A. Last night at dinner, I noticed that everyone was using bread to eat with 
    instead of silverware.
B. Yes, eating your curry or vegetables with your bread is a custom in this 
    country.

A. Is this where I catch the Super Shuttle?
B. Yes, this is where you catch the Super Shuttle. Where are you headed?
A. I am headed home to Pasadena.
B. You can tell where each van is headed by the name on the front of the 
    van. I am the driver for Glendale, but your van should be along in a minute.
A. Do you know how much it costs to get to Pasadena?
B. I believe the cost of that trip is sixty dollars.
A. Do you know if the shuttle goes directly to Pasadena, or does it make a 
    lot of stops?
B. Before you pay the driver, you need to ask him. He needs to be upfront 
    with you about the number of stops he will be making.
A. Do I need to have exact change?
B. You don't need exact change, but it is useful to have smaller bills.

A. They told me inside that I should catch the Super Shuttle here.
B. You are in the right place to catch the Super Shuttle. What is your 
    destination?
A. I am trying to get to my home in Pasadena.
B. Look at the sign on the front of the van to tell where each van is 
    headed. My van is going to Glendale, but yours will be along in minute.
A. How much does a trip to Pasadena cost?
B. If I remember correctly, that trip costs sixty dollars.
A. I am hoping that this shuttle goes straight to my city without making a 
    bunch of stops.
B. Always ask the driver how many stops he plans to make before you pay him.
A. If I have large bills, should I break them while I am waiting?
B. It is better if you have cash close to the amount of the fare. There is 
    an ATM machine right over there.

A. Am I in the right place to catch the Super Shuttle?
B. This is the Super Shuttle stop. Where are you trying to get to?
A. My final destination is my home in Pasadena.
B. The destination of each van is always written across the top. I have 
    Glendale written on mine, but your van will be here shortly.
A. What is the price of a shuttle trip to Pasadena?
B. The trip to Pasadena costs sixty dollars.
A. I need to know if this shuttle is going to make a lot of stops or go 
    straight to Pasadena.
B. If you find out the driver will be making too many stops on the way, you 
    may wish to wait for a more direct shuttle.
A. What should I pay the driver with?
B. There is an ATM machine over by that wall. It is best if you have bills 
    close to the amount that you will owe.

A. It's great to be home!
B. Did you have a nice trip?
A. It had its surprises, but when all was said and done, it was a good trip.
B. What was your favorite part?
A. I loved our full moon beach party.
B. What were the people like? Were they friendly?
A. The people were basically quite friendly.
B. Did you bring me anything?
A. I brought you a lovely souvenir that I will be giving you for your 
    birthday next week.
B. I can't wait until I get to be the one to go on vacation.

A. I love traveling, but I love coming home, too!
B. Did you enjoy your vacation?
A. It had its ups and downs, but I really enjoyed it.
B. What did you like the best?
A. I absolutely enjoyed the kayak trip we took to an outlying island.
B. Did you enjoy the people there? Did they like you?
A. Most of the people seemed happy that we were there, but some of them 
    really resented visitors.
B. What did you bring back for me?
A. I did get you something, and I will give to you as soon as I unpack.
B. Next time, I am going to save up my money and go with you.

A. How nice it is to be home again with all of my family!
B. Did your journey turn out as well as you had hoped it would?
A. All trips have good and bad points, but this one had mostly good ones.
B. Did you have something you enjoyed the most?
A. My favorite thing was the amazing food.
B. Were the people receptive to having visitors?
A. You could tell that some people did not have a favorable view of 
    Americans.
B. Did you get me a souvenir?
A. Of course I brought you something!
B. Next time I am going to be the one to go away, and you can stay home and 
    feed the dog!

A. I'd like to reserve a hotel room.
B. That should be no problem. May I have your full name, please?
A. My name is John Sandals.
B. Hello, Mr. Sandals. My name is Michelle. What days do you need that 
  reservation, sir?
A. I'm planning to visit New York from Friday, April 14 until Monday, April 
  17.

A. My plans are to be there April 14th to the 17th. 
B. We have new room rates, sir. Will that be acceptable to you?
A. It depends on the price, of course. What is it?
B. It's $308 a night.
A. I have no problem with that.
B. Great! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?
A. Definitely nonsmoking. I can't handle that smell.

A. No problem.
B. Great, Mr. Sandals. Your reservation is confirmed. Now all I need is your 
  phone number.
A. Of course! It's area code 626-555-1739.

B. Not a problem. May I have your name, please?

B. Hi, sir. My name is Michelle. Could you tell me when you need the room?
A. Right now. I plan to be there in April from the 14th to the 17th. 
B. Perhaps you didn't know that we have new room rates. Do you find that 
  acceptable, sir?
A. Maybe. How much is a room?
B. The price per night is $308.
A. That sounds fine to me.
B. Fantastic! Would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room?
A. I hate cigarettes! Nonsmoking.
B. That'll be nonsmoking. Now, do you approve of a single queen-size bed?
A. That'll be no problem.
B. I'm happy to hear that, sir. Your reservation is all set except for your 
  phone number.
A. Sure! My number is 626-555-1739.
B. 626-555-1739. Thank you for doing business with us, Mr. Sandals.

A. I need a hotel room.
B. That's no problem at all. May I have your name, please?
A. Certainly. My name is John Sandals.
B. It's a pleasure, Mr. Sandals. My name is Michelle. What days will you need a 
  room?
A. Friday afternoon, April 14 through Monday morning, April 17.
B. One minor problem, sir. Our prices are now slightly higher. Is that 
  acceptable, sir?
A. Please tell me the price, so I can make a decision.
B. It'll be $308 nightly.
A. That's a reasonable price.
B. Good! Now, sir, do you have a preference for smoking or nonsmoking?
A. I quit smoking, so nonsmoking.
B. I hear you, sir. Nonsmoking. Now, about the bed, is a queen-size okay?
A. A queen sounds great.
B. Okay, sir, let me reserve those dates, there. Now, if you'll just tell me 
  your phone number.
A. That would be 626-555-1739.
B. That's 626-555-1739. Thank you so much for choosing our hotel, sir!

A. I need a room for a few days.
B. That won't be a problem. Could you please tell me your name?
A. John Sandals. That's S A N D A L S.
B. Sir, I'm Michelle, and I run the front desk. Please tell me the days you'll be 
  here.
A. I'll be there in April: Friday through Monday, the 14th through the 17th.
B. We recently changed many things here, sir, including our prices. Do you 
  mind, sir?
A. Possibly. What's the actual price?
B. The price will be $308 a night.
A. $308! That's not bad.
B. Very good. Now, Mr. Sandals, about the room, smoking or nonsmoking?
A. Nonsmoking, definitely! 
B. Most of our clients prefer nonsmoking. Now, does a queen sound okay?
A. Yes, that'll be just fine.
B. One more second, sir. Your reservation is now verified, so all I need is 
  your phone number.
A. It's 626-555-1739.
B. Let me repeat that: 626-555-1739. Okay, sir, we look forward to seeing you 
  in April!

A. Can I reserve a hotel room? 
B. I assure you, that's not a problem. What is your full name, please? 
A. My name's John Sandals.
B. It's a pleasure to assist you. Please tell me when you'll be needing the 
  room, sir.
A. If my plans don't change, I'll need a room April 14 till April 17.
B. Sir, our room prices are slightly higher than you may have thought. Will 
  that be okay?
A. Tell me how much it will be, and I can tell you if it's okay.
B. Only $308 per night, before taxes, of course.
A. $308 a night? That's a fair price.
B. Now, as for the room, sir, do you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?
A. Nonsmoking, please.
B. Nonsmoking. Now, sir, does a single queen-size bed meet your approval?
A. I have absolutely no problem with that.
B. Queen, nonsmoking. Okay, sir, your room is reserved. Now if you'll just 
  give me your phone number. 
A. Not a problem. The number is 626-555-1739. 
B. Thank you for making a reservation with us. We look forward to seeing you 
  in April!

A. I have a reservation. My name is John Sandals.
B. May I see your ID, please, Mr. Sandals?
A. Certainly. Here it is.
B. Thank you. Do you have a credit card, Mr. Sandals?
A. Yes, I do. Do you accept American Express?
B. Sorry, sir, just VISA or MasterCard.
A. Here's my VISA card.
B. Okay. You're in room 507. It's a single queen-size bed, spacious, and 
  nonsmoking. Is that suitable?
A. Yes, it sounds like everything I expected.
B. Here's your key, sir. If you need anything, just dial 0 on your room phone.

A. I have a reservation under the name of Sandals.
B. Could I see your ID, please, sir?
A. Of course! Let me take it out of my wallet.
B. Thank you, sir. Now, do you have a credit card, sir?
A. Yes, of course. Is American Express okay?
B. I'm sorry, sir. Only VISA or MasterCard.
A. In that case, here's my VISA.
B. Thank you. Your room number is 507, queen bed, nonsmoking. Is that 
  agreeable to you, sir?
A. Yes, I'm easy to please.
B. Very good. Here is your room key, sir. If you need anything at all, please 
  dial 0.

A. My name is Sandals, I have a reservation.
B. May I see your identification, please, sir?
A. Here you are.
B. Thanks. Do you have a credit card, sir?
A. Of course. Will American Express do?
B. I'm very sorry, sir. We accept only VISA or MasterCard.
A. No problem. Here's my VISA.
B. Thanks. Room 507 is a spacious, nonsmoking room, with a queen bed. Does 
  that meet your expectations?
A. Yes, that sounds like what I want.
B. That's wonderful, sir. Now, here's your key. Should you need anything, just 
  dial 0.

A. I'm John Sandals, and I have a reservation.
B. Would you show me your ID, sir, please?
A. Here you go.
B. Thank you very much. Now, sir, do you have a credit card?
A. Certainly! Would you like my American Express card?
B. Regrettably, Mr. Sandals, we accept only MasterCard or VISA.
A. I thought American Express was accepted everywhere. Never mind. Here's my 
  VISA.
B. Thanks. You're in room 507, a big, nonsmoking room, with a queen bed. Is 
  that okay, sir?
A. Yes, that's just fine.
B. I'm happy to hear that. Here is your key. Just dial 0 if you need anything.

A. My name is John Sandals, and I've got a reservation.
B. May I see some identification, sir, please?
A. Sure. Here you are.
B. Thank you so much. Have you got a credit card, Mr. Sandals?
A. I sure do. How about American Express?
B. Unfortunately, at the present time we take only MasterCard or VISA.
A. No American Express? Okay, here's my VISA.
B. Thank you, sir. You'll be in room 507, nonsmoking, with a queen-size bed. 
  Do you approve, sir? 
A. Yes, that'll be fine.
B. That's great. This is your key, sir. If you need anything at all, anytime, 
  just dial zero.

A. I've got a reservation here. My name is John Sandals.
B. Mr. Sandals, may I see your ID, please? 
A. One second, please, while I dig it out here. 
B. Now, sir, do you have a credit card?
A. Yes, I do. Do you accept American Express?
B. I'm sorry, Mr. Sandals, but we accept only MasterCard or VISA.
A. That's okay, I've got plenty of cards. Here's my VISA.
B. Okay. You're in room 507. It's a single queen-size bed, spacious, and 
  nonsmoking. Is that suitable?
A. Yes, that's just what I wanted. 
B. Here's your key, sir. If you need anything, just dial 0 on your room phone.

A. I need to request a wake-up call for tomorrow morning.
B. What time do you want the call?
A. I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.
B. We can certainly do that. Expect a call from us at 7:00, and then again at 
  7:15.
A. Actually, can I change the latter wake-up call to 7:30 am?
B. I can certainly do that. Is there anything else?
A. I can't think of anything. If I do think of something, I'll be sure to call 
  again.
B. Okay. Good night, sir.

A. I need a wake-up call tomorrow morning.
B. Of course. When would you like the call?
A. Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.
B. No problem. We'll give you both calls.
A. Do you know what, let's change the second call to 7:30.
B. No problem. Anything else, sir?
A. Not at the moment, thank you.
B. Let me know if you do need anything.

A. Can you give me a wake-up call tomorrow?
B. Certainly. What time would you like us to call you?
A. I need two wake-up calls, if you don't mind, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.
B. Not a problem. We'll call you tomorrow morning at 7, and again at 7:15.
A. On second thought, you'd better make that second call at 7:30 instead of 
  7:15.
B. Said, and done. Will there be anything else?
A. No, that gets it for now, thank you.
B. Well, give us a call if there's anything more we can help you with.

A. Tomorrow I'm going to need a wake-up call.
B. Not a problem. What time shall we call you?
A. I always hit the snooze button, so give me two calls, one at 7 and another 
  at 7:15.
B. It'll be our pleasure. We'll call you at 7 and then at 7:15.
A. Oops, cancel that. Change the second call to 7:30, will you, please?
B. No sooner said than done. Can I help you with anything else?
A. No, that's about it for now.
B. Okay, sir. Have a pleasant evening.

A. I need a wake-up call tomorrow.
B. What time would you like your wake-up call?
A. I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.
B. That is no problem at all, of course. You'll get a call at 7:00, and 
  another at 7:15.
A. Then again, I think 7:15 is too early. Change 7:15 to 7:30, please.
B. So, that'll be a call at 7 and another at 7:30. Do you have any other 
  requests?
A. Not just now, but if I do think of something later, I'll give you a ring.
B. Okay, sir. Sleep well.

A. I've got to get up early tomorrow, so please give me a wake-up call.
B. Of course. We can give you a call anytime you like.
A. Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.
B. Your wish is our command. Expect a call at 7, and another one at 7:15. 
A. Wait a minute! I don't like 7:15, now that I think about it. Change it to 
  7:30.
B. The second call is now changed to 7:30. Is there anything else we can help 
  you with?
A. Nothing that I can think of right now. If something comes up, though, I'll 
  call you.
B. We're here all night long if you need anything.

A. The front desk told me to ask you for sightseeing advice.
B. Of course. I'd be more than happy to help. I am, after all, the hotel's 
  concierge.
A. Concierge? What exactly is that?
B. We advise you on where to visit, eat, or shop during your stay here in New 
  York.
A. Great! So where should I start my sightseeing?
B. The Statue of Liberty is always a good place to begin.
A. I saw the Statue of Liberty on my last visit here. Can you recommend 
  somewhere else?
B. Hmm. What type of interests do you have?
A. In my spare time, I really like to view art and go running.
B. Aha! Have you been to Central Park or the Museum of Modern Art?
A. No, but I've heard a lot about both.
B. Well, Central Park is wonderful for running. Afterwards, you should head to 
  the Museum to enjoy the art.
A. Great! That sounds like a plan. Thanks a lot.
B. I'm sure you'll have a good time there.

A. I was told to see you about going sightseeing.
B. It's my pleasure. I'm the hotel's concierge, at your service.
A. Concierge? Could you explain that to me?
B. We help direct hotel visitors to popular places to visit, eat, and shop.
A. Very good. So where shall I begin my sightseeing?
B. I would suggest the Statue of Liberty.
A. Gee, I've already seen the Statue of Liberty. What about another site?
B. Let me see. What do you like to do in your spare time?
A. I really like to run. And I like art.
B. Well, there you go! Have you ever visited either Central Park or the Museum 
  of Modern Art?
A. No, but I've been meaning to.
B. Well, Central Park is fantastic for running. Then you can go to the Museum 
  to look at the beautiful art.
A. That sounds like a great plan. I'll do that.
B. Enjoy your run and your visit!

A. I need some sightseeing advice.
B. That's what I'm here for, sir. Every good hotel has a concierge like me.
A. I don't travel a lot. What exactly is a concierge?
B. A concierge helps visitors like you find great places to visit, shop, and 
  eat.
A. That's great! So tell me, where should I go first?
B. I'd suggest that you start at the Statue of Liberty.
A. You know, I've already been there. Can you suggest another place?
B. Maybe. Tell me what you like to do in your spare time.
A. When I have some free time, I often spend it running or at museums.
B. Well, have you ever been to either Central Park or the Museum of Modern 
  Art?
A. No, but I sure would like to.
B. Central Park is great for just about everything outdoors. Then you can 
  visit the Museum of Modern Art.
A. Both places sound great. I'll try to do that today.
B. Enjoy the views at both places.

A. I'm going sightseeing, but I'd like to get your advice first.
B. I'm only too happy to help. Tourists should always check with their 
  concierge first.
A. Concierge? I'm not familiar with that word.
B. A concierge directs visitors to the city's great tourist, shopping, and 
  eating places.
A. That sounds great. Now, is there any place that I should hit first?
B. Well, if you're like most people, you'll want to go to the Statue of 
  Liberty.
A. I've already seen it, I loved it, but today I want to go somewhere else.
B. Sure! Tell me about your interests.
A. I like to run and I like to see the works of the masters.
B. You'll get along fabulously at Central Park and the Museum of Modern Art! 
  Have you been to either?
A. No, I just haven't had the opportunity.
B. You'll love Central Park for running. Later on, you can go to the Museum of 
  Modern Art.
A. Thank you. That's what I'll do.
B. This might be the best day of your visit.

A. I need some sightseeing advice. I was told to come to see you.
B. As your concierge, it is my pleasure to help you, sir.
A. Concierge? Are we speaking English here?
B. A concierge helps you find all the great places for visiting, shopping, and 
  eating.
A. What would you suggest that I visit first?
B. How about starting at the Statue of Liberty? Many people like to begin 
  there.
A. The last time I was here, I visited the Statue. So do you have another 
  place in mind?
B. I think so. Tell me what interests you.
A. I'm big on running, although maybe I like art even more than running.
B. Then you must go to Central Park and the Museum of Modern Art! Have you 
  been to either one?
A. No. I haven't had a chance to go to either of them.
B. Both places are usually crowded with natives and tourists. You'll love the 
  Park and the Museum.
A. Thank you. That's great advice.
B. This might be the best day of your visit.

A. Can you give me some advice about going sightseeing? 
B. Your concierge, sir, is the right person to ask when you need sightseeing 
  advice.
A. What in the world is a concierge?
B. We direct visitors to all the great tourist, shopping, and eating spots in 
  the city.
A. Then what would you recommend as a starting point for my sightseeing?
B. Definitely the Statue of Liberty. I think that that is everyone's favorite 
  first stop. 
A. Actually, I've already been there twice. Do you have another suggestion?
B. I think I can come up with something. How do you spend your spare time?
A. I keep my body healthy by running and my mind active by visiting museums.
B. Well, the Museum of Modern Art and Central Park were made for you! Have you 
  gone to either one?
A. No, although I've heard great things about both of them.
B. You don't want to miss either place. Central Park and the Museum of Modern 
  Art are big and beautiful.
A. Sounds great! I'll get my running gear and then I'm out of here.
B. This is a day you're going to remember for a long time.

A. I need a suggestion for a restaurant here in Manhattan.
B. Certainly! How much are you planning to spend on dinner, sir?
A. My date's very sophisticated, so I'm sure she would expect nothing but the 
  best.
B. May I suggest our own hotel restaurant? It got three stars in the latest 
  restaurant review.
A. No, thank you, I want to go out on the town. What other ideas do you have?
B. There's always Gramercy Tavern. They have live jazz. The food is delicious, 
  but very expensive.
A. That sounds like a good place to take a date. Can you make a reservation 
  for me?
B. As you wish, sir. You'll have a wonderful time there.

A. Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to?
B. Of course! How much would you like to spend on your meal?
A. My date is quite sophisticated. She would expect nothing less than the best.
B. Well, how about our own hotel restaurant? It's conveniently located and has 
  a three-star rating.
A. That's a good idea, except I want to go out, not stay in. Something else, 
  maybe?
B. Well, how about Gramercy Tavern? It's a very popular tourist spot, with 
  great food and music.
A. That sounds good! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation?
B. Of course, sir. You've made a good choice.

A. So, now I need your help again, if you don't mind. I'm taking a date to a 
  restaurant.
B. I'd love to help you! What is your budget for the dinner?
A. She strikes me as being very sophisticated. Only the best will do for her.
B. Well, what do you think about our very own hotel restaurant? It is very 
  upscale, with a three-star rating.
A. I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight. How about another 
  restaurant?
B. The Gramercy Tavern is highly rated. It has great food and live jazz, but 
  it's not cheap.
A. Yes, that sounds like a winner. Would you please call them to reserve a 
  table?
B. I'm already dialing, sir.

A. I'm taking a date to a restaurant, so could you please direct me to a good 
  one?
B. But of course! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner?
A. She deserves nothing but the best, of course.
B. In that case, I would suggest our own hotel restaurant. The chef, the food, 
  and the service are outstanding.
A. I promised her I would take her out to a restaurant. Do you have another 
  one in mind?
B. You can always go to Gramercy Tavern. It's quite popular, despite its 
  expensive entrees. 
A. Great food and lots of patrons? What more could I want? Please 
  reserve a table for me.
B. Yes, sir. You're going to have a great time.

A. I'm taking my date to a restaurant. Could you tell me about one or 
  two good ones?
B. My pleasure! How much would you like to spend on your date?
A. She will want an excellent restaurant, of course.
B. You should know that our hotel chef was trained in Paris. The service and 
  food are world-class.
A. I wanted to go out somewhere, not stay here. Do you know of another good 
  restaurant?
B. You can't go wrong with Gramercy Tavern. It's famous for its food, service, 
  and live jazz.
A. I like that! Could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight?
B. At once, sir. You'll love this place, I assure you.

A. Well, I've got a date. Now I need to find a restaurant. Can you help me?
  
B. No problem, of course! How much would you like to spend to impress the 
  lady?
A. Nothing but the best for a pretty woman!
B. Sir, the restaurant you seek is right here. This hotel has a three-star 
  restaurant.
A. I sort of suggested that we would go out on the town. Do you have 
  another suggestion?
B. Gramercy Tavern is at least as good as our own hotel restaurant. Plus, they 
  have live jazz.
A. Gramercy Tavern? I think I've heard of that before. Call to get us a 
  table, okay?
B. Right away, sir. She will be impressed with your local knowledge.

A. I'd like to order dinner.
B. What would you like?
A. I'd like to order a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare.
B. I'm sorry. We're currently out of filet mignon. May I suggest the 
  porterhouse instead?
A. I'd prefer the filet, but the porterhouse will do.
B. And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?
A. Normally, I would take you up on that suggestion, but just the champagne 
  will do for tonight.
B. Okay, no strawberries. Room service will be charged to your amenities 
  account. Is that all right?
A. That's fine.
B. It will be up shortly. Enjoy your food, sir.

A. Could I order dinner?
B. Of course. What would you like?
A. I want a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare.
B. I'm so sorry. We ran out of filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse 
  instead?
A. That's too bad, but the porterhouse will be okay.
B. May I be so bold as to suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the 
  champagne?
A. Not tonight, thank you.
B. No strawberries. We'll charge your amenities account, if that's okay.
A. Charge it to whatever account you like.
B. Your meal will be delivered as soon as it's all ready. Enjoy!

A. Could you bring me some food, please?
B. Sure. What do you fancy?
A. Can I have a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium 
  rare?
B. Sir, the filet mignon was so popular tonight that we ran out. May I suggest 
  the porterhouse?
A. No filet? Okay, porterhouse will be fine then.
B. Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?
A. Not tonight, but thank you for the suggestion.
B. Okay. This will be charged to your amenities account, okay?
A. No problem.
B. Your food will be brought to you momentarily. I hope you enjoy it.

A. I'd like you to bring me some food.
B. Just name it, sir.
A. Please send up a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium 
  rare.
B. Regrettably, we're currently out of filet mignon. May I suggest the 
  porterhouse instead?
A. Sure, I love porterhouse, too.
B. Would you be interested in chocolate-covered strawberries with the 
  champagne?
A. I'd love to, but I'm allergic to strawberries.
B. Okay, no strawberries tonight. The items will be charged to your amenities 
  account.
A. Go right ahead.
B. Our staff will bring you your order in as short a time as possible.

A. I need something to eat, please.
B. Tell me what you're hungry for.
A. I feel like champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare.
B. Unfortunately, we're out of filet mignon at the moment. May I suggest the 
  porterhouse instead?
A. I prefer filet, but porterhouse is good, too.
B. Perhaps I could interest you in chocolate-covered strawberries with the 
  champagne?
A. Just the champagne will be fine, thank you.
B. You'll see this charge on your amenities account.
A. That's fine.
B. It won't be long until your food is delivered. I know you'll enjoy it.

A. Can I order something from the kitchen?
B. Just tell me what you'd like, please.
A. A bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare would hit 
  the spot.
B. I hate to tell you this, but we have no more filet mignon. May I suggest 
  the porterhouse instead?
A. Sure! Right now, I would even eat hamburger!
B. Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne? 
A. Thank you, but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries. 
B. That'll be a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and porterhouse, all 
  charged to your amenities account.
A. Not a problem.
B. Please call if you have any other requests. Your food will be delivered 
  promptly.

A. I have a little problem with room 507.
B. What exactly seems to be the problem, Mr. Sandals?
A. I found cockroaches in my room.
B. Cockroaches, sir? That's unbelievable.
A. I've seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room.
B. Sir, are you sure you haven't seen the same silverfish nine times?
A. There are nine cockroaches in my room. I don't have time for your 
  disbelief!
B. I apologize. One moment, please, while I transfer you to my supervisor.

A. I'm in 507. I have a few problems with my room.
B. What is that problem, sir?
A. There are cockroaches in my room.
B. Are you sure, sir? Flies I could believe, but cockroaches?
A. I've counted nine different cockroaches, and I accidentally stepped on 
  another one.
B. Sir, we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel.
A. You dare to doubt me?
B. I'm sorry, sir. Let me transfer you to my supervisor.

A. There's a big problem with my room. I'm in 507.
B. Would you tell me the nature of the problem, sir?
A. I have cockroaches crawling in my room.
B. Perhaps you saw a silverfish, sir.
A. I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see.
B. Sir, you haven't been drinking by any chance, have you?
A. How dare you question my statement!
B. Forgive me. You're 100 percent correct. Allow me to transfer you to my 
  supervisor.

A. There's a major problem with room 507.
B. I'm sorry to hear that. Please tell me the exact problem.
A. This room is overrun with cockroaches.
B. There has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel, sir.
A. I stopped counting at nine.
B. Sir, this hotel just passed a thorough insect inspection with flying 
  colors.
A. Your inspector needs spectacles. The fact is that cockroaches are running 
  rampant.
B. I apologize, sir. Just a second, while I transfer you to my supervisor.

A. I'm in 507, and I have a big problem. 
B. I'm so sorry. Kindly tell me what the problem is, sir.
A. Everywhere I look, I see cockroaches.
B. Perhaps you could look again, sir, to double-check.
A. The next cockroach I see will be number ten.
B. Mr. Sandals, I've worked here five years without seeing one cockroach.
A. I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you!
B. You're right, sir. Please let me transfer you to my supervisor.

A. I have a little problem with room 507.
B. Problems are what we're here for, sir. Please tell me your problem.
A. This room is filthy with cockroaches. 
B. Were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them, sir?
A. I've already seen nine of them and, as they say, eight is enough! 
B. Sir, sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots.
A. You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement!
B. I'm very sorry, sir. Will you please hold while I transfer you to my 
  supervisor?

A. I want to change rooms. In fact, I want a refund for tonight!
B. And the problem is, sir?
A. Cockroaches have taken over my room!
B. My apologies, sir. We'll give you a new room and refund the value of your 
  current room.
A. Thank you. I want to continue to be able to recommend this hotel to others.
B. We always try to serve our guests in the most agreeable way possible.

A. I want to change rooms immediately, plus a refund for tonight.
B. I'm sorry, sir. Exactly what is the problem?
A. I'm knee-deep in cockroaches!
B. I'm so sorry, sir. We'll give you a new room immediately, and give you a 
  refund also.
A. Thank you. I'm glad that this hotel strives to keep its reputation intact.
B. Sir, we always try to please our guests.

A. I'm quite upset! I want a new room and a refund for tonight.
B. Forgive me, sir, I haven't been told what the problem is.
A. I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches!
B. My apologies, sir. We'll transfer you to a new room at once and give you a 
  full refund.
A. Thank you. I didn't want to have to take this to court.
B. Sir, we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy.

A. This room is unacceptable. I want a new one, and I want a refund for 
  tonight.
B. Would you please tell me the exact problem, sir?
A. I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches!
B. Oh, my gosh, they're back? Another room at once, sir, plus a full refund, 
  of course.
A. Thank you very much. This has been a most unsettling experience.
B. Sir, our guests are our reason for being.

A. This room is unfit for humans. I want another room, and I want a refund for 
  tonight.
B. Perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem, sir.
A. In a word, cockroaches!
B. Oh, no, are they back? I'll give you another room immediately, sir, and a 
  refund for tonight.
A. Thank you. I'm glad that you don't believe that your guests are liars.
B. Sir, without happy guests, we are nothing.

A. I want to change rooms. In fact, I want a refund for tonight!
B. If you tell me the exact problem, I can be more helpful.
A. Cockroaches have declared war on my room!
B. Allow me to apologize. I'll give you another room right now, and a full 
  refund for tonight.
A. Thank you for not asking me to collect the roaches in a jar as evidence.
  
B. Sir, only your mother wants to please you more than we do.

A. Excuse me. Does this hotel have a fitness facility?
B. Yes, we try to accommodate all needs of our patrons, including fitness.
A. Where is your fitness facility located?
B. The gym is just below the lobby. Take the elevator or the stairs. You can't 
  miss it.
A. Is there an additional surcharge for the gym?
B. No, the gym is free to guests. Take your room key, however, so you can get 
  in.
A. What time is the gym open, and what time does it close?
B. The gym is open seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day.
A. Do you offer trainer services along with the gym?
B. Unfortunately, no. If you want a trainer, you'll have to use another gym.

A. Pardon me. Does your hotel have a fitness facility?
B. Yes, sir. We try to anticipate all our guests' needs, including fitness.
A. Great! Where is it?
B. Sir, the gym is just below the lobby. You can take the elevator or the 
  stairs.
A. Do I have to pay extra?
B. No, sir. It's gratis. Just take your room key so you can get in.
A. What are the gym hours?
B. You'll be happy to know that it's open 24/7.
A. Great! Is a trainer available?
B. I'm sorry, but no. We used to have a trainer, but then he had an 
  unfortunate accident.

A. Does this hotel have an exercise facility?
B. But of course! We have a great exercise facility.
A. Good. Now exactly where is it?
B. It's located right under our lobby. Just take the elevator or the stairs 
  one flight down.
A. Is this going to cost me anything?
B. No, sir. The gym is absolutely free. However, be sure to take your room key 
  with you.
A. When does the gym open and close?
B. The hours couldn't be better, 24/7.
A. Very good. Now, is there a trainer down there?
B. I wish I could tell you yes, but no, there isn't.

A. Do you have a place where I can exercise?
B. Yes, sir. We have a fine exercise facility.
A. I'm happy to hear that. Now, would you tell me where it is?
B. You're actually standing above it. Just take the elevator or stairs down 
  one level.
A. Is the hotel going to charge me a dollar a minute for gym use?
B. No, sir. There's no extra charge. All you need is your room key to open the 
  door.
A. And the gym hours are?
B. Sir, you'll be pleased to know that our gym never closes.
A. One more question: Do you have a trainer?
B. We might be getting one in the near future. But at the present time, no.

A. Excuse me. Do you happen to have a gym here?
B. Yes, sir. I think you'll find our gym quite satisfactory.
A. So, where do I go to exercise?
B. It's only one flight down, sir. Just take the elevator or the stairs.
A. Am I going to be charged extra for using the gym?
B. Sir, you can use the gym for free. All you need is your room key.
A. Great! Now tell me, what are the hours of this gym?
B. Sir, our gym is open around the clock, every day of the week.
A. Do you have a trainer to help me work out?
B. I'm sorry, sir, but we have no trainer.

A. I'd like to request some more amenities.
B. Amenities? What do you mean by amenities, sir?
A. The free stuff, you know, the soap, lotion, shampoo, etc.
B. I see. Sir, if I may ask: Have you used up all the amenities in your room?
A. Not at all. I still have enough for the next few days.
B. Then what is the problem, sir?
A. I need some to keep as souvenirs!
B. Souvenirs?
A. Yes, souvenirs. Trinkets to remember my trip by!
B. We do have a souvenir shop on the first floor, sir.
A. That's not the same. I never pay for hotel souvenirs!
B. I'll call housekeeping. Someone will be up with more amenities shortly.

A. I need more amenities, please.
B. Could you be a little more specific, sir?
A. To be more specific, the free stuff, like soap, lotion, and shampoo.
B. I understand. Now, you're saying that you've already used up all your 
amenities?
A. No! I've got all I need for my stay here.
B. So, what's the problem?
A. I need souvenirs!
B. You want some souvenirs!
A. Yes, yes. Souvenirs.
B. But, sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items.
A. That's not the same thing. If you buy hotel souvenirs, they have no 
sentimental value.
B. I understand, sir. I'll call housekeeping. You'll have your souvenirs 
shortly.

A. How do I get more amenities?
B. I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure I understand.
A. I'm talking about the free stuff, like soap and shampoo.
B. Oh, I see. So, you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities.
A. No, no. I've got plenty left.
B. Now I'm confused again! What is the problem?
A. What am I going to do about souvenirs?
B. Oh, I get it! You want souvenirs!
A. Yes, I've got enough soap for my use, but no extra soap for souvenirs.
B. Sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items, and as a guest you get a 
discount.
A. Please! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs.
B. I understand completely, sir. Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a 
moment.

A. Yes, I need more amenities.
B. By amenities, exactly what do you mean, please?
A. You know, the things that are free, like the soap and the shampoo.
B. Okay, I got it. You've already run out of all your amenities?
A. No, I still have plenty left, even if I took three baths a day.
B. I'm more confused now than before. How is there a problem?
A. I need to take home some souvenirs!
B. Okay, finally I understand. You would like souvenirs!
A. Yes, souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection.
B. If it's souvenirs you want, sir, just visit our souvenir shop. It has 
everything.
A. Are you kidding? Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs?
B. No problem at all, sir. Housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you 
like in a bit.

A. I need some more amenities, please.
B. I'm not sure I'm following you, sir.
A. Specifically, I'm talking about the little things, like soap and shampoo.
B. Oh, now I understand! So, you've already used up all your amenities?
A. No, I'm not even halfway through my supply.
B. I'm losing you, sir. What's the problem?
A. What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs?
B. Okay, I got it. You're collecting souvenirs!
A. There you go. My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs.
B. Have you visited our souvenir shop, sir? It's loaded with all kinds of items.
A. I've never paid for a hotel souvenir in my life, and I don't intend to start 
now.
B. Sir, housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily.

A. I need to copy a document immediately.
B. We have a copy machine in our computer lab, located on the first floor.
A. Great! How much is it for a copy?
B. The price per copy is ten cents.
A. That sounds reasonable. I'll be down there immediately.
B. THere shouldn't be any long lines, sir.

A. I need to copy something right now.
B. Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine, sir.
A. Great! How much per copy?
B. Sir, one copy is ten cents.
A. I'll be down there shortly.
B. You probably won't have to wait for anyone, sir.

A. I need to make a copy of something at once.
B. There's a copy machine on the first floor in our computer lab, sir.
A. Fantastic! Is there a charge?
B. It's ten cents a copy, sir.
A. I'm only making one copy, so I guess I can afford it.
B. A dime is still a bargain, sir.

A. I need to make a copy of a document as soon as possible.
B. No problem, sir. There's a copy machine in our computer lab.
A. Very good. How much does each copy cost?
B. Each copy will cost you a dime, sir.
A. A dime? I remember when copies used to cost a nickel.
B. There aren't many things you can get for a nickel, sir.

A. Can you tell me where I could make a copy of a document right now?
B. Sir, you can come downstairs right now to the computer lab. 
A. That's great. I don't suppose the copy machine is free for guests? 
B. Sir, each copy is ten cents or one dime, whichever you prefer. 
A. In the good old days, it was only five cents a copy. I'll be right down.
B. Those were the good old days, sir, indeed.

A. I need a doctor immediately!
B. Sir, is everything all right?
A. My wife just collapsed on the floor!
B. Sir, I need you to calm down. Take deep breaths.
A. I'm sorry. It's just that my wife. I need the emergency room.
B. Sir, I'm dialing 911 on another line.
A. What's taking you so long?
B. I'm transferring you right now. Just remain calm.

A. Help me! I need a doctor!
B. What is the problem, sir?
A. My wife is on the floor!
B. Sir, please calm down. Take a deep breath.
A. I need some help, right now!
B. Sir, I'm going to put you through to 911.
A. Hurry, please!
B. I'm transferring you right now, sir.

A. I need a doctor right now!
B. Tell me the problem, sir.
A. My wife just passed out!
B. Sir, it's difficult to understand you. Please take a deep breath and calm 
down.
A. Don't tell me to calm down! My wife is passed out!
B. I'm getting 911 on another line, sir.
A. Okay, but hurry.
B. Stay calm, sir, and talk clearly.

A. Get a doctor here, immediately!
B. What's the problem, sir?
A. My wife is on the floor, she's unconscious!
B. Sir, could you calm down a little bit, please?
A. Calm down?! My wife is unconscious, and you're telling me to calm down?!
B. Hold on just a second, sir. I'm dialing 911.
A. Hurry up, please.
B. I'm connecting you now, sir.

A. A doctor! I need a doctor! 
B. Give me some details, sir.
A. Something is wrong with my wife. She's lying on the floor.
B. Sir, if you don't calm down, you might have a stroke yourself. 
A. You're right, I'm beside myself with worry.
B. Hold on, sir. I'm connecting you with 911.
A. Time is critical. Hurry up!
B. I hope everything turns out well, sir. Here's 911.

A. I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop.
B. Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and a prompt will tell you 
the payment options. 
A. I don't have an Ethernet port. My computer runs entirely on wireless 
service.
B. That's too bad. But there are several alternatives, if you want to hear them.
A. Yes, please! Tell me about the alternatives.
B. We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor.
A. Very good. How much does that cost?
B. The service is free to hotel patrons. However, printing costs ten cents per 
page.
A. I see. And the other alternatives?
B. Alternatively, we do offer wireless in our lobby. You can bring your laptop 
down here.
A. Great! What if I need to print something in the lobby?
B. You would have to use the computer lab. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

A. I need broadband for my computer.
B. No problem. Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you're good 
to go.
A. That's a problem. My laptop has no Ethernet port, it's wireless only.
B. Hmm. Well, we have some alternatives, if you're interested.
A. Go ahead. I'm all ears.
B. We have a computer lab on the first floor.
A. That's great! How much is it?
B. It's absolutely free to guests. Except for printing, of course.
A. What about the other alternatives?
B. You could use your wireless right here in our lobby.
A. Yes, that's the ticket! And if I need to print something there?
B. Well, we don't have a printer in the lobby yet. You'll have to use the lab.

A. I'd like to get busy on my computer, but I need some broadband.
B. There's an Ethernet cable in your room. Just plug it into the back of your 
laptop.
A. I can't use Ethernet. My computer is wireless only.
B. That's okay. I can tell you about some alternatives we have.
A. Any alternative that works will be great.
B. Well, there's our computer lab on the first floor.
A. That sounds good. What's the charge?
B. The lab and the computers are no charge, but you have to pay for whatever you 
print.
A. That sounds good. Now, how about the other alternatives?
B. Of course. Our lobby is set up for wireless, so just bring your computer down 
here.
A. Use my laptop in the lobby? That's great! Now, if I need to print something 
there?
B. They plan to install a printer here. But until then, you'll have to use the 
lab.

A. I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup.
B. Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you'll be off and 
running.
A. That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port. Unfortunately, my laptop uses 
wireless only.
B. In that case, let me tell you about some alternatives.
A. Anything to get me up and running.
B. For starters, we have a computer lab.
A. Fantastic! What do I have to pay per hour?
B. The lab is completely free. But you do have to pay a dime a page for 
printing.
A. That's fine. Now tell me about the other alternatives.
B. Just bring your laptop down here to the lobby. We're set up for wireless 
right here.
A. Great! I like that suggestion, but what if I need to print something there?
B. Unfortunately, you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs.

A. How do I get online with my laptop?
B. Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you'll be online in a 
heartbeat. 
A. I see the cable. But my computer runs on wireless only.
B. No problem. I'll tell you about our alternatives.
A. Yes, I'd love to hear what the alternatives are. 
B. Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor.
A. Great! But is it free?
B. Sir, the computers are free to guests, but you do have to pay a nominal 
printing fee.
A. You said there were other alternatives?
B. Just use your computer here in the lobby. It's set up for wireless.
A. That sounds like a winner. Now if I need to print something in the 
lobby?
B. We might have a printer here next month. But for now, you'll have to go to 
the lab.

A. I'd like to order a restock on my minibar.
B. You finished everything in there, sir?
A. Absolutely everything. 
B. What would you like to order?
A. Three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam.
B. Uh-huh. What else do you want?
A. The apples were great. Could you bring a couple more up?
B. No problem. Is there anything else I can get for you?
A. Some grape juice would also be nice.
B. I'll get all of that for you right away. Someone should be up shortly.

A. I need my minibar restocked.
B. Everything is gone, sir?
A. There's not a drop left of anything.
B. Is there anything in particular you'd like?
A. Yes, the Perrier and the Jim Beam hit the spot. Let me have three more of 
each.
B. Got it. Anything else?
A. I really liked the apples. Bring me a couple of apples, please.
B. Not a problem. Anything else?
A. Yes, one more thing: some grape juice.
B. Someone will be up shortly with your order, sir.

A. My minibar is empty.
B. You already finished off everything, sir?
A. I finished off everything.
B. Would you like anything in particular?
A. The Perrier and the Jim Beam. Let me have three more of each.
B. Beam and Perrier. Anything else, sir?
A. I really loved the apples in my room. Bring me a few more, please.
B. Sure thing. Might there by anything else?
A. Yes, speaking of fruit, bring me some grape juice, too.
B. Perrier, Jim Beam, apples, and grape juice. It will all be there shortly, 
sir.

A. How do I restock my minibar?
B. You've drunk everything, sir?
A. I finished it all.
B. Do you want the whole minibar, or just certain items?
A. Send me up three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam.
B. That's three Jim Beams and three Perriers. Anything else, sir?
A. The apples in my room were delicious. Bring me a few more, please.
B. Okay. Are you sure there isn't anything else?
A. You know, some grape juice would be really nice, too.
B. Be patient for just a few minutes, sir, and someone will be at your door.

A. My minibar is completely empty.
B. Everything in that minibar has been consumed, sir?
A. Everything's gone. 
B. Is there anything special you'd like?
A. Just bring me three bottles each of Jim Beam and Perrier.
B. Okay, sir. Three of each. Would you like anything else?
A. The fruit basket was great. I need a few more apples, please.
B. Perrier, Jim Beam, and apples. Is that it for now?
A. Yes, one last thing: I could use some grape juice.
B. Your order will be brought to you momentarily, sir.

A. Is there a swimming pool in this hotel?
B. We don't have a full-sized swimming pool, but we do have individual swim 
stations.
A. What exactly does that mean?
B. Basically, a swim station is like a treadmill, except instead of running, you 
swim.
A. That sounds really neat. Is there an extra charge for these swim stations?
B. If you're a registered guest, you have free access to our swim stations.
A. Are the swim stations open 24 hours, like the rest of the gym?
B. To conserve electricity, the stations operate only from 7:00 a.m. till 10:00 
p.m. 
A. I'll go down there as soon as I can!
B. I don't think you'll be disappointed. People really seem to like the swim 
stations.

A. Does this hotel have a pool?
B. I'm sorry, sir, we don't have one. However, in our gym, we do have swim 
stations.
A. I'm not sure I understand.
B. Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in, but against a current.
A. Cool. What will they think of next? How much are they?
B. Sir, guests pay nothing to use the stations.
A. Excellent! Now what are the hours?
B. The gym is open 24/7, but the stations are open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. only.
A. I'm going to change into my trunks right now!
B. I think you'll like the experience, sir. It's a great workout.

A. Do you have a swimming pool in this hotel?
B. We don't have a pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in the gym.
A. I never heard of a swim station. Is that like a train or bus station?
B. It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against.
A. Holy cow! I never heard of such a thing. How much do they cost?
B. As a guest, sir, you pay nothing.
A. This sounds better every second. Now, when can I use the stations?
B. If you want to swim, you can visit the gym any day between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.

A. Oh, boy! This is going to be great. I'm going to the gym right now!
B. I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout, sir. Everyone seems to like the swim 
stations.

A. I think I've looked everywhere, but I haven't seen a swimming pool here.
B. This hotel has no full-size pool, but we do have swim stations in our gym.
A. Swim stations? Whoever heard of such a thing?
B. You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill.
A. All that exercise in a little pool! Do I have to pay anything?
B. The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge.
A. Very good. Now can you tell me the hours of operation?
B. They're available anytime between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., seven days a week.
A. Wow! I can't wait to change into my trunks!
B. The swim stations are very popular, sir. I hope you don't find a line down 
there.

A. I've been looking for a swimming pool, but I haven't found one yet.
B. We have no pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in our gym.
A. Swim stations? Could you be a little more explicit?
B. You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere? Well, it's the 
same thing.
A. Gee, that's a great idea. Now, how much do I have to pay?
B. The stations are absolutely free to guests, sir.
A. Great! Now, when can I go down there and use the stations?
B. The swim stations are open daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.
A. Boy, oh boy! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks.
B. Be warned, sir. At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded.

A. I need to get a taxi.
B. We have a variety of transportation services. Would you prefer a private 
  vehicle to a taxi?
A. No, that won't be necessary. I just need a taxi.
B. Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine. That's such a stylish way to travel.
A. Just a taxi, please.
B. And what is your destination?
A. I'm going to Rockefeller Center.
B. I see. What time do you want to depart from the hotel?
A. I want to leave as soon as possible.
B. Okay, a taxi will arrive in seconds, sir.
A. Thank you, I'm coming down now.
B. It won't be but a few seconds, sir.

A. I need a taxi, please.
B. We have various transportation services. Would you prefer a private 
  vehicle?
A. No, thanks. A taxi is just fine.
B. May I suggest a limo? It's nice to pamper yourself once in a while.
A. I don't want anything except a taxi, thank you.
B. I understand. And where will you be going?
A. Rockefeller Center.
B. And what time would you like to be picked up?
A. The sooner the better.
B. A taxi will be here shortly, sir.
A. Great! And remember, a taxi, not a limo.
B. A taxi it is, sir.

A. Can you get me a taxi?
B. We offer various types of transportation. Perhaps you'd like to upgrade to 
  a private vehicle?
A. Thanks, but no thanks. A taxi will do just fine.
B. In that case, how about a limo? Then you can travel in style.
A. No, I hate limousines. They're gas guzzlers.
B. Got it, sir. Where would you like the taxi to take you?
A. My destination is Rockefeller Center.
B. What time do you want to leave the hotel?
A. As soon as possible.
B. I'll call the taxi immediately, sir.
A. I'm coming downstairs now.
B. A brand new taxi is pulling up now, sir.

A. I'm going to need a taxi.
B. You don't have to restrict yourself to a taxi. We can offer you a private 
  vehicle.
A. A private vehicle, huh? No, a taxi is okay.
B. Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi.
A. No, I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo.
B. No upgrade of any kind. And where might you be going?
A. I'm headed to Rockefeller Center.
B. When shall I tell the taxi to be here?
A. Right now.
B. The taxi will be here immediately, sir.
A. Good, I'm leaving my room in about one minute.
B. You won't have to wait a second, sir.

A. I need a taxi.
B. We could easily provide you with a private vehicle, if you'd prefer.
A. No, the taxi will do.
B. Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine.
A. No, thank you. Taxis and I get along just fine.
B. No private vehicle, no limo. Got it. Where are you going?
A. I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center.
B. What time should the taxi be here to pick you up?
A. I'm ready to go right now.
B. I'll have a taxi for you momentarily, sir.
A. Great! As soon as I brush my teeth, I'll be downstairs.
B. You'll enjoy our new, clean taxis, sir.

A. Could you please reserve a taxi for me?
B. Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking?
A. A private vehicle? No, thanks, I won't need one.
B. Even better than a private vehicle is a limo. How does that sound?
A. T A X I, please.
B. A taxi it is. Where will you be headed? 
A. Rockefeller Center. Can you get the taxi here immediately, please?
B. A taxi will be here in just a minute, sir.
A. Good. I'll get my coat and come downstairs.
B. The taxi will be ready when you are, sir.

A. I am checking out. Here is the key to my room.
B. Thank you. I'll just print out your receipt, and then you're free to go. 
  Here you go!
A. Thanks.
B. If you don't mind me asking, how did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel?
A. This hotel could use some insecticide, but my time in New York was 
  thoroughly delightful.
B. That's very honest of you. Rest assured that this hotel will have no 
  insects next time.

A. I want to check out. Here is my room key.
B. One second, sir, while I print out your receipt. Here you are.
A. Thanks.
B. May I ask, sir, if you enjoyed your stay?
A. Except for one night, I enjoyed the hotel. And I loved New York, of 
  course.
B. Thank you for your honesty. I assure you there will be no cockroaches next 
  time.

A. I'm leaving. Here is my key.
B. Just one second, sir, and I'll give you your receipt. Here you go.
A. Thank you very much.
B. Sir, did you enjoy your stay here?
A. Most of my time here was pleasant. And New York itself is fantastic.
B. I'm glad you enjoyed the city, anyway. But please don't think too unkindly 
  of us.

A. I'm out of here. Here's my key.
B. Give me just a few seconds, sir, and I'll hand you your receipt. Here you 
  are.
A. I thank you.
B. I hope you enjoyed your stay, sir.
A. I only had nine little problems here. Other than that, I enjoyed my stay, 
  and I loved the city.
B. I apologize again for the cockroaches, sir. I hope you have a nice trip home.

A. My stay is over. Here's the key to my room.
B. Thank you. And here's your receipt, sir.
A. Many thanks.
B. I hope your stay here was satisfactory, sir.
A. This could be a great hotel, once you get rid of the insects. The city 
  itself is great.
B. I'm glad that the little problem didn't ruin your visit. Please have a 
  pleasant trip home.

A. This visit is over for me. Here's your room key.
B. Thank you for that, and in return, here's your receipt.
A. And thanks to you.
B. I hope you'll visit us again, sir.
A. I'd be willing to try this hotel again, if you can promise me no more 
  cockroaches.
B. I guarantee you that our little “friends” won't be back. I hope your trip 
  home is pleasant.

A. My amenities bill says that I owe $10 for a movie, but I never 
ordered one.
B. Let's see. It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p.m. for the movie 
"Titanic."
A. That's absolutely wrong! I was out exploring the city Monday night.
B. Okay, let me see what I can do.
A. Thank you. I didn't think it would be this simple.
B. I can take the $10 off your bill, but I need to charge you $2 for the 
service.
A. Are you serious? I have to pay $2 for a movie I never watched?
B. Unfortunately, sir, it's how the computer is programmed.
A. This is outrageous! I'm never coming back to this hotel again!
B. I'm sorry, sir. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters.

A. I just discovered that I owe $10 for a movie that I never ordered.
B. Let me check, sir. You were charged for watching "Titanic" Monday night.
A. That is absolutely incorrect! I was out on the town Monday night.
B. Okay, sir, bear with me a moment.
A. Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word.
B. One slight problem, sir. I need to charge you $2 to remove this error from 
your file.
A. You can't be serious. You're making me pay $2 for a movie I never watched?
B. I feel your pain, sir.
A. Absolutely unbelievable! You people should be ashamed of yourselves. 
B. I agree with you, sir, but all I do is work here.

A. You guys are charging me $10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw.
B. Let's see, sir. According to your file, you watched "Titanic" Monday evening.
A. The wrong information is in my file. I was at a concert Monday night.
B. Well, your word overrules the file, sir. One moment, please.
A. I knew you'd see it my way.
B. Sir, I deleted the $10, but I had to add a $2 service charge to your bill.
A. Am I in the Twilight Zone? You're charging me for a movie I never saw?
B. Please don't blame me, sir. Blame the computer programmer.
A. This is highway robbery. I've got a good mind to call the police!
B. If it makes you feel any better, other guests feel the same way.

A. Why am I being charged $10 for a movie that I never ordered?
B. Sir, according to your file, you spent Monday evening watching "Titanic."
A. The file is wrong. I was at a great concert that night.
B. Well, this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong. Just a moment, 
please.
A. Thank you for taking care of it so quickly.
B. Sir, when I deleted the $10, the program automatically added a $2 service 
charge.
A. You can't do that! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made!
B. Sometimes you can't win for losing, sir.
A. Now I've seen it all! What a rip-off this place is!
B. I don't blame you, sir. Two dollars is a lot of money.

A. I need to know why I'm being charged $10 for a movie that I never 
ordered.
B. Hmm. Your file shows that you watched "Titanic" Monday night.
A. Monday night? Monday night I was at a great concert.
B. Well, as they say, garbage in, garbage out. Let me correct this error, 
please.
A. Thank you. It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly.
B. When I deleted the $10, the computer automatically added a $2 service charge.
A. Are you crazy? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your 
mistake?
B. Sir, if it makes you feel any better, the $2 service fee used to be $5.
A. Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have?
B. Unfortunately, sir, you'll have to pay the $2, whether you like it or not.

A. I'm checking out in about half an hour.
B. Whenever you're ready to check out, I'll be ready, sir.
A. Great! As you know however, the day in New York has hardly begun.
B. You're right. It's only 9:00 a.m.
A. Therefore, I think I'll explore New York some more. But I need to store my 
bags.
B. Sir, our storage facility is merely $5 an hour. You also need to leave a 
deposit.
A. My luggage isn't enough of a deposit?
B. Unfortunately, it isn't. VISA or MasterCard will suffice, though.
A. Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment.
B. Better hurry, sir. Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour.

A. I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes.
B. I'm ready when you are, sir.
A. Very good! Now, it's still morning here in New York.
B. You are so right, sir. The clock just struck nine.
A. I'm going to spend some time exploring the city. What can I do with my 
luggage?
B. Sir, right here we have a storage site. Its only $5 an hour, but you need to 
leave a deposit.
A. A deposit? Isn't my luggage a deposit?
B. I'm sorry, sir, but it isn't. Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of 
things nicely.
A. Let me think about this.
B. Okay, sir. But don't take too long. You only have 30 minutes.

A. Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes?
B. Just say the word, sir.
A. Excellent! Now, as you know, the day has barely begun.
B. I agree. The dew is still on the grass.
A. I want to hit a few more places in the city, but I need a place to put my 
luggage.
B. We do have a storage space for your bags. There's a small charge, plus a 
deposit.
A. Leave a deposit? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit?
B. Regrettably, no. But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit.
A. I'll have to think about this for a second.
B. Okay, sir, but don't think too long. Your checkout is only 30 minutes away.

A. In case you didn't know, I'm checking out in half an hour.
B. That won't be a problem, sir.
A. That's good to hear. Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me.
B. You're right, sir. Your whole day is still ahead of you.
A. I still have time to explore more of New York, but I need a place to secure 
my baggage.
B. We have a storage place here, but you have to leave a deposit.
A. A deposit, huh? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit.
B. Just present your VISA card, and there won't be any problems.
A. That deposit bothers me. Give me a minute.
B. Okay, sir, but remember how close it is to your checkout time.

A. I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes.
B. Thirty minutes or 30 seconds, sir, it doesn't matter, I'm ready for you.
A. Great! As you know, however, the day in New York has hardly begun.
B. There's nothing like getting an early start, sir.
A. What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots?
B. You can leave your baggage in our storage space, with a deposit.
A. Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit?
B. I wish it was, but it isn't. They will still want a credit card.
A. It's always something, isn't it? Let me think about this for a second. 
B. Don't forget that you have very little time, sir, before you have to check 
out.

A. I'd like to leave a parcel for one of my friends. Is that okay?
B. All I need is your name, the name of your friend, and the time of pick-up.
A. All of that's on the package. Can I just bring it down to your desk?
B. That would be most convenient for me. Thanks for your consideration!

A. I want to leave a parcel for a friend to pick up. Can I do that?
B. Just tell me your name, your friend's name, and when your friend is coming 
by.
A. I'll put all that information on the package and just bring it down to you. 
Is that okay?
B. That sounds great, sir. Thank you.

A. Can I leave a parcel with you for one of my friends to pick up later?
B. I just need your name and your friend's name. Also, tell me when he is coming 
by.
A. How about if I write all that on the package and then bring it down to you?
B. Perfect. Thank you for doing that.

A. I've got a parcel here that a friend is going to pick up. Can I leave it with 
you?
B. No problem. Just tell me your name, his name, and when he's coming by.
A. I'll just write all that info on the parcel itself and then bring it to you.
B. Sir, you make my work too easy. Thank you.

A. A friend is picking up a parcel. Can I leave the parcel with you?
B. By all means, sir. Just give me your name, his name, and when he will be 
coming by.
A. I can put all of that right on the package and then bring it down to you, if 
that's okay.
B. Well, thank you for doing that, sir. I wish all guests were like you.

A. I'm calling to cancel a reservation I made earlier in the week. 
B. To cancel your reservation, I need your name, phone number, and date of trip, 
please.
A. Rudy Randolph, 818-555-1234. My reservation begins on the second Monday of 
April.
B. I see your reservation on my computer. Let me just cancel it, and you'll be 
all set!
A. Thanks. I'll call again when things get better at home.
B. You're welcome.

A. Great! I'm Rudy Randolph, 818-555-1234, and my reservation was for April 9 to 
15.
B. Sir, let me hit the delete button, and your reservation will be 
cancelled.
A. That was nice and fast. Thanks.
B. Not at all.

A. I hate to do this, but I've got to cancel a reservation I made earlier this 
week.
B. All I need is your name, phone, and reservation date.
A. My name is Rudy Randolph. I'm at 818-555-1234. The reservation was for April 
9.
B. Randolph, Rudy. Let me hit one button, sir, and now your reservation is 
cancelled.
A. Thank you. I'll make another reservation as soon as I can.
B. It's been my pleasure to help you.

A. My wife is sick, so I have to cancel a reservation I made.
B. If you'll just give me your name, phone, and date of visit, I can cancel your 
reservation.
A. I'm Rudy Randolph at 818-555-1234, April ninth to the fifteenth.
B. Mr. Randolph. Okay, one second, sir, and there you go. Your reservation is 
now cancelled. 
A. I wish everything in life was so simple, thank you.
B. Not a problem, sir. Please remember us in the future.

A. I am interested in buying a house and need some information.
B. Yes, of course. What area are you interested in?
A. I am interested in Pasadena or Arcadia.
B. What size house would you like?
A. We need a medium-sized house with at least 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.
B. Are you interested in being in a particular school district?
A. Yes, we want to stay in the ABC School District.
B. Would you like a home near the lake or would you prefer a view?
A. I would love to have a home with a view.
B. Fine, I will begin a search for the perfect home for you. I will call you 
    in a few days.

A. I would like to discuss purchasing a home with you.
B. I can help you. What location are you looking for?
A. I would like to live in Pasadena or Arcadia.
B. Have you thought about what your needs are in terms of size?
A. We would like a smaller cozy cottage with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom.
B. Is living in a particular school district important to you?
A. No, we don't really care because they are all pretty good around here.
B. Are you interested in purchasing on the lake, or would you like a home 
    with a view?
A. We really want to live in a lakeside home with a dock for our boat.
B. Now that I have an idea of what you want, I can begin my search.

A. I have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you.
B. I have time to speak with you. Where would you like to purchase your 
    house?
A. I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia, but would be open to other 
    suggestions.
B. How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need?
A. We have several generations of family living in our household and so need 
    a very large home.
B. Do you need to be located in a particular school district?
A. It doesn't matter, as we do not have any children.
B. Is a view important to you, or would you rather be located on a lakeshore 
    lot?
A. In a perfect world, we would like a home with a view of the lake.
B. Thank you for all of the information. I will help you find the perfect 
    house for you.

A. I need to see if I qualify for a home loan.
B. I can help you. How much money do you make per year?
A. I make around one hundred thousand dollars per year.
B. How long have you been on your current job?
A. I have only worked at this job for 6 months, but I have a longer job 
    history elsewhere.
B. Do you have any other outside income from rental property or a trust?
A. No, I only receive my salary.
B. Do you know your credit score?
A. I think that it is around 600.
B. By crunching the numbers and putting in your expenses, I estimate that 
    you can afford a house of around five hundred thousand dollars.

A. I am trying to see if I can afford to purchase a home that I wish to buy.
B. We can figure that out right now. How much do you earn annually?
A. My wife and I earned one hundred and fifty thousand dollars last year.
B. How many years have you held your current position?
A. I have been at my current job for 10 years.
B. Is there any extra income that you receive other than salary?
A. I collect one thousand dollars a month from a rental property.
B. Have you ever figured out your credit score?
A. I try not to think about it!
B. Adding in your expenses, I calculate that you can spend three hundred 
    thousand on a house.

A. I want to go house shopping, and I want to know what I can afford to buy.
B. There is a formula that can help us figure that out. What is your annual 
    salary?
A. I earn sixty-five thousand dollars per year.
B. What is the length of time that you have worked at the job you have now?
A. I have been at the job I now have for 2 years, and I have been with the 
    company for 6 years total.
B. Do you receive any other income?
A. I own a small rental unit with a partner, and I receive five hundred 
    dollars a month from that unit.
B. Do you know what your credit score is?
A. I don't know, but the last time I checked, it was very good!
B. You are in good shape. Figuring in your other expenses, you can easily 
    afford a house costing seven hundred thousand or maybe even a little more!

A. I would like to make an appointment to look at houses.
B. Sure, would you prefer looking in the morning or afternoon?
A. I would prefer mornings.
B. Can you go during the week, or can you only go during the weekend?
A. Going to look at houses during the week is best for me.
B. Where would you like me to pick you up?
A. I will meet you at the real estate office.
B. I am thinking of looking at three houses, and it will take about two 
    hours.
A. That sounds good to me.
B. Once I contact the owners and confirm the times, I will e-mail you a 
    schedule.

A. I would like to pick a time to look at houses with you.
B. Would mornings or afternoons be best for you?
A. It is easier for me to take off work in the afternoon.
B. It is best if we can go during the week; does that work for you?
A. Because of work, I can only go look at houses on the weekend.
B. Would you like to meet at the real estate office, or should I pick you up 
    at home?
A. If you could pick me up at home, that would be great.
B. We could spend most of the day looking at houses to see all that we have 
    to see.
A. That might be a little too much, but we'll see how it goes.
B. I will fax you a schedule as soon as I contact the owners to confirm the 
    times.

A. Can we choose a time to look at houses together?
B. Can you do that in the mornings, or would the afternoons be best?
A. Either way is good for me.
B. There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area. Would that 
    okay with you?
A. I can take a little time off work, or I can go on a weekend, also.
B. We could meet at the real estate office, or I could pick you up at your 
    home.
A. I am leaving from work, so maybe I could just meet you at the first house 
    that we will look at.
B. I can think of five houses that we should look at. It will take most of 
    the day.
A. I would like to see as many as possible.
B. When I have confirmed the times with the owners, I will e-mail you our 
    plans for the day.

A. I really like the way this house looks.
B. Yes, it has great curb appeal.
A. The landscaping is wonderful!
B. Yes, it is nice, but wait until you see the interior.
A. I see what you mean!
B. The carpeting and paint are all new, as well as the window treatments.
A. I love the sage green carpeting with the sunset-colored walls.
B. Come and see the kitchen.
A. Look at that beautiful countertop material and the double sink!
B. Let's go check out the bedroom and bathroom.
A. I really like the Jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom.
B. I am happy that you like the house. We should write down what we like so 
    that we can remember it.

A. I have a good feeling about this house.
B. Yes, I liked it the first moment I pulled up to it.
A. I love the paint job!
B. If you like the outside, you are going to really love the inside.
A. What a beautiful home!
B. You'll notice that the window treatments, carpeting, and drapes are all 
    new.
A. I like the way the blinds give you privacy from the street.
B. Follow me into the kitchen. You will love it.
A. I love that they put a wine storage area in the kitchen.
B. The best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom.
A. I love the relaxing colors in the tile and floor covering!
B. Let's take a few pictures so that we can remember what we like about this 
    house.

A. This looks like a very nice house.
B. You know, I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on 
    it.
A. The style of the exterior is just what I've been looking for!
B. The exterior is only half of the story. The interior is incredible.
A. This home is gorgeous on the inside!
B. Everything that you see on the walls, floors, and windows is brand new.
A. The wall colors totally suit the style of this house.
B. Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen.
A. I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops.
B. The master suite is the best. Let's go look at that next.
A. There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed, and I love the light in 
    this room.
B. I know that you like this house, but let's take a look at the others 
    before you make up your mind.

A. I am not sure I even want to look at this house!
B. It is a bit of a fixer-upper. Let's take a look inside.
A. It doesn't look much better inside this place.
B. You know, with a little elbow grease and paint, you could spruce it up a 
    bit.
A. There are hardly any windows in here, and that makes it really gloomy.
B. Let's go check out the kitchen. The printout says that it is quite large.
A. Look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper.
B. Maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities. Follow me, please.
A. What's that smell?
B. Perhaps we should move on to the next listing.

A. This house is not looking all that great from here
B. You can't really tell everything about a house from the outside. Let's go 
    inside.
A. I don't think that it is looking any better inside here.
B. I think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better.
A. It is just too dark in here with so few windows.
B. I hear that the kitchen is quite large. Let's go check it out.
A. The kitchen may be large, but it doesn't have any storage space.
B. The master suite is supposed to be quite elegant. Maybe it will be a 
    little better.
A. How many dogs live in this house?
B. I think that we have seen all that we need to see here. Let's go look at 
    another house.

A. From the looks of this house from the outside, I don't really think that 
    I want to go inside.
B. From here, it does look like it could use a little work. Let's see what 
    the interior looks like.
A. I am not impressed by the interior of this house.
B. Sometimes all a place needs is a little bit of cleaning and some fresh 
    paint.
A. With so few windows, how can you even see what the problems are?
B. I think that we should check out the kitchen. It is listed as roomy and 
    spacious.
A. Where are you supposed to store things without any cabinet space?
B. The picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite. I think that we 
    should go look at it since we are here.
A. Is there a dead animal somewhere in here?
B. Well, I think that it is pretty safe to say that this is not the house 
    for you.

A. I would like to make an offer on this house, but I don't know much about 
    the process.
B. As your realtor, I am here to take care of this process. How much were 
    you planning on offering?
A. I really like the house and will pay the full asking price of three 
    hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
B. We want to leave ourselves some bargaining room. Let's offer three 
    hundred and twenty thousand dollars.
A. That sounds good, but I don't want this house to get away from me.
B. The market is fairly down right now, so the offer is a realistic one.
A. When will we know if they accept the offer?
B. The owners usually respond to an offer within a few days.
A. Should I be contacting my bank in the meantime?
B. You are already pre-qualified for your loan, so you are in good shape.

A. I have never bought a house before and don't know how to make an offer.
B. The process of actually making the offer is something that I will take 
    care of for you. What price were you considering offering?
A. I love this house and would be willing to pay the full asking price of 
    three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
B. Let's leave some room on this offer. I think that three hundred and 
    twenty thousand dollars is a fair offer in this housing market.
A. We could try that, but I really want this house!
B. It is common practice to offer and then have a counter-offer.
A. How long will it take to find out if they are going to accept the offer?
B. The sellers are usually fairly quick to respond. They want to get things 
    moving.
A. Should I tell my bank that I have made an offer?
B. There really isn't anything else to do right now except wait. You are 
    already pre-qualified for your loan.

A. I have never done this before and don't know where to begin as far as 
    making an offer on this house.
B. Leave the details of making the offer up to me. What were you thinking 
    you should offer?
A. I absolutely must have this house and will pay three hundred and fifty 
    thousand dollars or more.
B. It is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a 
    counter-offer. How about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars?
A. I hope that the owners aren't insulted by that offer.
B. Your offering price is not out-of-line. The owners will either take it or 
    make a counter-offer.
A. Does it usually take very long for the owners to get back to you with an 
    acceptance?
B. It usually doesn't take very long for owners to respond to an offer. 
A. Should I be in touch with my bank to tell them to get the loan papers 
    ready?
B. The only thing you should do now is relax. You already are pre-qualified 
    for your loan.

A. Have the owners come up with a counter-offer to my offer to buy their 
    home yet?
B. The owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand 
    dollars.
A. Should I accept their offer?
B. There are two ways to respond. You can either come back with another 
    offer or go with their counter-offer.
A. What if I make another offer, and they don't accept it?
B. No one else has made an offer, so you could make another offer if you 
    want to do so.
A. I think that I would like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand 
    dollars as a counter-offer.
B. OK, I will present your counter-offer to the owners tonight.
A. How long before I find out what their decision is?
B. By now, the owners probably have a pretty good idea of what they will 
    accept. It will go quickly.

A. Your office called and said that the owners had made a counter-offer to 
    my offer to purchase their house.
B. To your offer of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, the owners 
    have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars.
A. I think that maybe I should accept their offer.
B. You, of course, have two ways of responding. You can say yes or come up 
    with another offer.
A. I want to make another offer, but I am afraid that they will decline and 
    I will lose this house.
B. There is always a chance that someone could outbid you, but you could try 
    one more offer if you like.
A. I would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a 
    counter-offer.
B. After the owners get home from work tonight, I will approach them with 
    your offer.
A. Can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me?
B. I don't think that it will take as long as the response to the first 
    offer.

A. Have the owners answered back with a counter-offer for my offer to 
    purchase the house?
B. In response to your offer, the sellers have decided to counter-offer 
    three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars.
A. That sounds pretty good to me, but I am not sure what to do.
B. You can accept this offer or decline it and come up with another offer.
A. If I make another offer and they refuse, then what?
B. Personally, I would consider making one more offer, but it is up to you 
    to decide what to do.
A. Let's try going with three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a 
    counter-offer.
B. I will contact the sellers with your current offer.
A. Do you think that this will move along fairly quickly?
B. Usually the response to the second offer moves along a bit more quickly 
    than the first one.

A. Did you get a chance to speak with the sellers about my counter-offer?
B. Yes, and I think I have good news for you.
A. Did they accept the counter-offer?
B. Yes, they accepted your counter-offer, but they want you to pay for the 
    home inspection.
A. How much will that cost?
B. It will cost you around five hundred to one thousand dollars for a home 
    inspection.
A. Can I choose the home inspector?
B. Yes, you are paying for it, so you get to choose. I would pick the best 
    one.
A. So, when are you going to inform the owners of my acceptance?
B. I will call the owners right now. They will be happy to hear the good 
    news.

A. I was anxious to find out what the sellers had to say about my 
    counter-offer.
B. I was able to contact them so, if you'll step into my office, we'll talk.
A. Did they go with the proposed counter-offer?
B. They want you to pick up the cost of the home inspection, but they 
    accepted your offer.
A. Is a home inspection very expensive?
B. It can cost between five hundred and one thousand dollars.
A. Do I get to choose who inspects the home?
B. Yes, you get to choose. I would spend a little more to get a really 
    thorough inspection.
A. Can you call the owners with my acceptance right away?
B. I am going to contact the sellers immediately. They were looking forward 
    to your acceptance.

A. Were you able to contact the owners about my counter-offer?
B. Yes, please have a seat, and we'll discuss this right now.
A. I hope that they accepted the counter-offer.
B. The counter-offer was acceptable to them, but they want you to pay for 
    the home inspection.
A. Will the home inspection cost me a lot?
B. It can cost as little as five hundred dollars and as much as one thousand 
    dollars.
A. Is it my choice as to who inspects this house?
B. Yes, it is your choice as you are paying for it. Make a wise investment 
    and choose the best inspector you can find.
A. How long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance?
B. Let's call them right now. I am sure that they will be happy to hear that 
    you have agreed to pay for the inspection.

A. Let's pull over and look at that house over there.
B. Yes, that looks great! Is it on our Open House list?
A. Yes, it is on our list.
B. Well, it looks great from the curb. Let's go on inside.
A. Let's sign the registry. The realtor looks kind of busy right now.
B. OK, let's go check out the kitchen next.
A. look, they have some refreshments in here.
B. Make sure that you pick up a flyer with the information about the home.
A. Does it say how much they are asking for this house?
B. Yes, it seems to have been discounted from two hundred and thirty-five 
    thousand to two hundred and twenty-five thousand.

A. I see an Open House sign over there, and I think we should go check it 
    out.
B. I think that looks like a very nice house. Is it on our Internet listing 
    for Open Houses?
A. Yes, I see it listed on the printout we got off of the Internet.
B. I love the beautiful lawn. What a great front entryway!
A. We need to make sure to put our names in the registry so the realtor 
    knows we were here.
B. That works for me. We can check out the kitchen next.
A. On such a hot day, it is thoughtful to have water out for potential 
    buyers.
B. Check out the flyer with all of the home's information on it.
A. What is the price of this house in the flyer?
B. They have changed the asking price since it first went on the market. It 
    is now two hundred and twenty-five thousand.

A. I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front.
B. What a wonderful neighborhood! Can you find that house on our Open House 
    list?
A. Yes, that is one of the houses that we have on our list.
B. They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses. Let's see 
    what the inside looks like.
A. I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent 
    know that we were here.
B. Signing the registry is a good idea. I think I want to see the kitchen 
    next.
A. I really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot 
    day.
B. I need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it.
A. Is the current asking price listed on the flyer?
B. The asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five 
    thousand dollars.

A. I heard that you finished my home inspection, and I was wondering how it 
    went.
B. First of all, we need to understand what I was looking for. Do you know 
    what the purpose of an inspection is?
A. I am not sure what a home inspection is all about.
B. I went there to check for problems with the home, so you aren't surprised 
    when you move in.
A. Wouldn't the owners have told me about any problems?
B. Sellers aren't always truthful, and there might also be problems that 
    they aren't aware of.
A. Can I require the owners to fix the problems?
B. You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the 
    problems.
A. What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home?
B. There were no major problems. One leaky pipe under the sink and two 
    broken roof tiles was all that I found.

A. Can you tell me the results of my home inspection?
B. Before I answer that, I want to make sure that you know what I was 
    looking for. Are you clear on what I was looking for?
A. I never had a home inspection before.
B. I inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a 
    quick walk-through.
A. I asked the owners, and they said that everything was great with the 
    house.
B. The owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house. Some 
    things are hidden, but might still be a problem for you in the future.
A. I heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow 
    closes.
B. I inform you of the problems. If there are major problems, you can 
    decline to buy the house or they may wish to fix any problems.
A. What kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection?
B. I found some fairly major problems. A major support beam in the roof is 
    broken, and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the second-floor joist.

A. I came in to see how my home inspection went.
B. First of all, I need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is. 
    Do you understand what I was doing there?
A. I had a home inspection before, but didn't really understand it.
B. I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it.
A. The owner said that the roof had leaked, but that he got it fixed last 
    month.
B. Sellers aren't really all that objective. They may have gotten used to a 
    leaky faucet, but it is still broken.
A. Are the sellers responsible for fixing the problems with the house?
B. The owners may wish to pay to have the problems fixed, or maybe the price 
    of the house can be reduced.
A. Did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection?
B. The house has a very outdated electrical system. Many of the switches and 
    outlets do not work and are unsafe.

A. I am here to sign my escrow papers.
B. I will tell you ahead of time, that there is a lot to sign here, but I 
    will help you every step of the way.
A. Should I have brought anything with me?
B. Basically, what I need from you now is your driver's license or some ID 
    that shows your residency status.
A. Where do I start?
B. We will be going through these papers one by one. I will be explaining 
    them all to you, and you can ask questions as we go.
A. Can I make a phone call to a friend if I have a question?
B. We do not want you to sign any documents that you do not understand. You 
    may get assistance with any questions that you have.
A. Will the house be mine when we finish these documents?
B. This is the last thing you need to do, but it may take a while for the 
    papers to be processed.

A. Your assistant said that it was time to come in and sign my escrow 
    papers.
B. Don't be intimidated. There is a lot to sign, but I will explain 
    everything to you very clearly.
A. Do you need anything from me?
B. All the papers have been drawn up, but I will need to see your picture ID 
    so we can notarize these papers.
A. There are a lot of papers!
B. We are going to go through these bit by bit. You will have plenty of time 
    to read the fine print.
A. My dad is going to be here in a minute to help me go through this with 
    you.
B. We want you to get any outside help that you need. Do not ever sign 
    documents that you don't understand.
A. Can I start moving in after I finish signing these documents?
B. When these papers get processed, the house will be yours!

A. I am very nervous about signing my escrow papers.
B. Escrow involves a lot of paperwork, but I will explain all of the steps 
    to you as we go along.
A. What should I have brought with me?
B. The only thing I will need to see is your driver's license, as I will be 
    notarizing these papers.
A. I feel a little overwhelmed by so many papers.
B. Don't worry about how many papers there are. We are going to look at them 
    one at a time.
A. My boyfriend is an attorney and told me that I could fax him anything if 
    I had a question.
B. Please get any outside help that you need in understanding your escrow 
    documents.
A. Is this the last thing that I will need to do before the house becomes 
    mine?
B. At the close of escrow, the house will be yours!

A. When can I move into my new house?
B. The current owners will be moving out on Tuesday, so technically you 
    could pick up the keys and move in on Wednesday.
A. Will the utilities be turned on?
B. You need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer 
    the utilities to your name.
A. I really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned.
B. If I were you, I would take a few days to take care of those things 
    before you move in.
A. I was thinking that I should have my new appliances delivered as we are 
    moving in.
B. That would be perfect. That way, someone will be there, but you will have 
    them right away.
A. Can you help me on my move-in day?
B. I think that I have something else really important to do on that day. I 
    just can't remember what it is.

A. What would be a good day to finally move into the house?
B. You can pick up your keys on Tuesday night. When you actually move in is 
    up to you.
A. Will the electricity and water be on, or do we need to do something to 
    get it turned on?
B. Make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when 
    you will be moving in.
A. The carpet needs to be cleaned, and I want to paint the walls a different 
    color.
B. An empty house is easier to paint and clean. Take a few days to take care 
    of those things before you start moving your furniture in.
A. I want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house.
B. I think that will work out just fine. It will help when you move your 
    groceries in and need to keep them cold.
A. Would you be willing to help me do a few things on the day I move in?
B. My grandmother needs me to help her trim her roses that day.

A. What would be the earliest that I could actually move into my new house?
B. The keys will be turned in on Tuesday night. The house will be yours at 
    that time.
A. What should we do to make sure that we have the electricity and water 
    turned on?
B. You can tell the utility company what day you are moving in, and they 
    will transfer the utilities to your name.
A. There are a few things that we want to do to the place, like painting and 
    carpet cleaning.
B. Take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint. It will be 
    harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived.
A. I asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving 
    in.
B. That will be good. You are going to want your stove and refrigerator 
    right away.
A. I could use some help on moving day. What are you doing on Saturday?
B. I think I am getting a fever and will be too sick to help you. Here, feel 
    how hot my head is!

A. I am interested in selling my home and would like to know what is involved.
B. You have come to the right place. When were you interested in selling your 
home?
A. I just received a job transfer and need to relocate right away.
B. How long have you been in your current home?
A. I have lived in my home for about 10 years.
B. As I am sure that you are aware, the market has fallen in the past year. 
People are more likely to make money if they have owned their home for a while.
A. Will I be able to recover the money I paid for my home?
B. It is hard to say, but whatever house you buy will also be costing you a lot 
less.
A. What is the next step in selling my home?
B. I would like to meet with you tomorrow to look at your property, and then you 
and I can figure out a contract.

A. I am looking for a realtor to help me sell my home.
B. I would be happy to help you with any questions that you might have. When 

A. I am interested in moving up to a bigger home, but first I need to sell the 
one I now own.
B. Have you owned your home for a long time?
A. I just bought my home two years ago.
B. I think you probably know that the market is not all that great. You are more 
likely to see a profit if you have owned for 8 years or more.
A. Will I be losing money if I sell right now?
B. It is impossible to predict with certainty what will happen, but you can 
purchase a replacement home at a lower rate also.
A. What can I do next to get the ball rolling on this sale?
B. If it works for you, I would like to come over and see your home. Then we can 
draw up a contract.

A. I am considering selling my home and would like information on doing so.
B. It would be my pleasure to answer any questions that you might have. Were you 
interested in selling in the near future?
A. I am just checking out the possibility of selling, as I am thinking of moving 
to Hawaii.
B. Is your home a recent purchase, or have you owned it for a while?
A. The house has been in my family for years, but I just became the owner 6 
months ago when my mother passed away.
B. Housing prices have fallen quite a bit. The longer you have owned your home, 
the greater the profit.
A. Am I going to lose my shirt selling my home right now?
B. It will all kind of even out. You may sell low, but you can also buy low.
A. What should we be doing to get the process started?
B. If it fits into your schedule, I could meet you tomorrow morning and we could 
take a look at your property. The next step would be us both signing a contract.

A. Thank you for coming to look at my house.
B. I really wanted to take a look and help give you an idea of what we need to 
do.
A. When will people come to look at my house?
B. Basically, there are two ways people can view your home. They can come to an 
Open House or they can come with a Realtor to view it during a private 
appointment.
A. Will people from other real estate offices be involved, or just from your 
office?
B. Your house is going to be listed as a Multiple Listing so that it will have 
the maximum exposure to a variety of people.
A. Will I know when people are going to come see my house?
B. We will set the parameters in the contract, but usually you will receive at 
least four hours of notification that someone is coming.
A. What happens during an Open House day?
B. You will be expected to be away during an Open House. I will take care of the 
details.

A. I appreciate you dropping by to look at my home.
B. It is useful for us to take a walk through your home together, so that we 
make sure that we are on the same page.
A. How do you show my home to potential buyers?
B. We will have an Open House or two on a weekend and we also will show your 
home with private appointments during the week.
A. Are you the only real estate office that will be showing my house?
B. We are placing your house as a Multiple Listing. That way, people who don't 
work for my particular office can show your home to their clients.
A. How will I know when to expect prospective buyers?
B. That will be set in your contract. Usually, you will be given four hours 
notice.
A. Can I stay home during an Open House day?
B. The seller is never at home during an Open House. I personally will handle 
the showing of your home.

A. Thanks for stopping by to evaluate my home.
B. I want to make sure that you are very clear on what the steps are to selling 
a home.
A. When can people come and see my home?
B. We will have several Open House weekends. Various realtors will also show 
your house during the week.
A. Will I know all of the realtors who will be showing my home, or will they be 
strangers?
B. Your house will be listed on what we call a Multiple Listing. That way it 
will be shown by a variety of realtors.
A. Can people just drop in anytime they feel like it?
B. We usually try and give you at least four hours of notification that someone 
is coming to look at your home.
A. Will I have to go away during an Open House day?
B. I will handle all of the work involved for the Open House. The only thing 
that you need to do is be somewhere else!

A. How much do you think that I should ask for my house?
B. Well, there are a lot of factors involved in setting an asking price.
A. What do you look at when setting an asking price?
B. We need to look at the selling prices for similar homes in the area. These 
will vary according to the condition of the home, specific location, and lot 
size.
A. Do I have to use the comparisons as the asking price for my house?
B. No, but a seller is not going to be able to get a loan if the selling price 
is a lot higher that what an appraiser feels the home is worth.
A. Isn't it better to price my house really high and see what I can get?
B. You shouldn't set the price of the house unrealistically high. Oftentimes 
buyers are put off by this practice.
A. Can I change my mind and lower my price if the home doesn't sell?
B. Sure, you can always lower your asking price.

A. I am not sure what the asking price for my house should be.
B. We have to take in a number of factors in setting an asking price.
A. What do we need to consider in establishing an acceptable price for a home?
B. The comparisons to other similar homes in your area give us a good indication 
of what your home is worth. 
A. Is the price that we get by looking at comparisons necessarily the asking 
price that I have to use for my home?
B. You don't have to use that particular asking price, but the buyer is going to 
have trouble getting a loan if the house is priced too high.
A. Should I just shoot for the moon and, if I have to lower the price, do it 
later?
B. You should be realistic in your pricing. Otherwise, many potential buyers 
just walk away.
A. Can we lower the asking price later if we need to?
B. We can always re-evaluate the asking price in a few weeks, if we aren't 
getting any offers.

A. What do you think the asking price of my home should be?
B. There are many things to take into consideration when pricing a home.
A. What is involved in figuring out an asking price?
B. We need to combine many factors regarding your home to come up with an 
accurate value for your home.
A. When you look at comparisons, do I necessarily have to ask that price?
B. You don't have to use the price from the comparisons as your asking price. 
However, you must be realistic in what you ask.
A. I think that I am going to set the price really high so that I have room to 
bargain with the buyers.
B. Don't go overboard in trying to get top dollar. More often than not, that 
strategy backfires.
A. Is it okay to lower the asking price if the first price isn't bringing in any 
offers?
B. If the market doesn't support your asking price, we can always re-evaluate 
our pricing and adjust it.

A. My wife thinks I should get a lawyer to look at the contract.
B. Well, it certainly wouldn't hurt to have a lawyer review it.
A. How much does a lawyer cost?
B. I don't know. A good real estate lawyer might cost $400 an hour.
A. That can't be legal! 
B. Just think how much it'll be 10 years from now.
A. Do you know any lawyers that are cheaper than that?
B. You'd have to check the yellow pages or go online.
A. There's no telling how many hours the lawyer will charge me for.
B. Also, it might take a week or two just to get an appointment.
A. I'd rather get this over with, so just show me where to sign.
B. Good man! I've marked all the places for you to sign and date.

A. My wife said to have a lawyer look at the contract.
B. That's always a good idea.
A. Do you know how much a lawyer runs?

A. Who can afford that?
B. A few years ago, $100 an hour was outrageous.
A. Can you help me find a cheaper lawyer?

B. I think lawyers are making twice what doctors are making.
A. Are there any lawyers that are cheaper than that?
B. The best advice I can give you is to Google it.
A. I can barely afford one hour, but certainly not two.
B. Remember, it might take a few days just to set up an appointment.
A. I really don't have the time or the money, so where do I sign?
B. Your wife will thank you. Just sign and date where the little red stickers are.

variety of real estate offices will be showing your home.

by to see your home.

at my house?

door. They use it while they are there and return it when they leave.

what they are doing.

uncluttered as possible.

sell them?

helps brighten a home's interior.
A. I get confused when trying to pick out colors that other people might like.
B. Lighter neutral colors are usually best. They make rooms appear larger.
A. The painting suggestion is a good one, but after that, what improvement will 
add value to my home?
B. Your interior should have only the most basic of furniture. Either store or 
get rid of any extra clutter.
A. What about replacing the floor covering?
B. I know that your carpeting is not brand new, but with a good steam cleaning, 
I think that it will look great.

cost too much?

home?

appealing?

A. What should I do to get ready for the Open House?
B. Your house needs to be as clean and uncluttered as possible.

the potential buyers who are looking at the house.

animals, would you? Your pets need to disappear for a bit!
A. Will someone be watching to make sure my expensive jewelry doesn't get ripped 
off?
B. We have two realtors to keep an eye on things at all times, but please don't 
keep valuable jewelry or guns in your home when it is being shown.

B. You can come home at four o'clock if you like. If it is rainy and slow, I 
will call you if I decide to end it a little early.

A. So how much did the buyers bid on our house?
B. Your asking price was three hundred thousand dollars. The potential buyers 
offered two hundred ninety thousand dollars.
A. That's a great offer!
B. Yes, it is a good offer. Before you accept, we should look at some details.
A. What else do we need to look at?
B. They want you to pay all closing costs. Of course, they are making the sale 
contingent on an inspection showing no major defects in the house.
A. I think that that sounds fair.
B. You could put in a counteroffer, but I know that these buyers also have their 
eye on another house down the street.
A. I definitely want to accept their offer.
B. Excellent decision! I will notify them immediately.

A. I am so anxious to hear what the bid was on our house!
B. Remember that we set the asking price at three hundred thousand dollars. The 
first offer is two hundred ninety thousand dollars.
A. That's way better than I expected so early in the game!
B. The offer is definitely a good one, but let's make sure we look at the whole 
picture.
A. What are the other considerations?
B. They want you to pay for the inspection, but they want to pick out the 
inspector. If the house is defective, they will want out of the deal.
A. I don't have a problem with that.
B. You could make them a counteroffer, but I know that you need a timely sale.
A. Please notify the buyers that I have accepted their offer.
B. I think that you are making the right choice. I will phone the buyers right 
away!

A. What did the buyers offer us on our house?
B. With the original asking price at three hundred thousand dollars, the buyers 
are willing to pay two hundred ninety thousand dollars.
A. I am really pleased with that offer.
B. I agree that the offer is in the ballpark. We need to consider everything 
before you accept.
A. Besides the selling price, what else is there to consider?
B. They want you to pay to have the cracks in the back wall fixed and a couple 
of the roof tiles replaced.
A. All of that is acceptable to me.
B. A counteroffer by you is always a possibility, but their price is very close 
to your asking price. You could risk losing the sale.
A. I wish to officially accept their offer.
B. This is a win-win situation for both you and the buyer. I am sure that you 
will both be happy with your decision.

A. I hear the young couple that came by the other day made an offer on our 
house.
B. Yes, the potential buyers made an offer this morning.
A. Is the offer a good offer?
B. The offer is pretty good. You asked three hundred thousand and they offered 
two hundred eighty thousand.
A. I would be willing to take two hundred ninety thousand, but no lower.
B. You could make a counteroffer of two hundred ninety thousand dollars. Would 
you like to do that?
A. Yes, I would like to make the counteroffer.
B. I will make the counteroffer immediately by phone.
A. What if they don't accept the counteroffer?
B. They can make a counteroffer themselves or state that their first offer 
stands.

A. I got a message on my machine that you received an offer on my house.
B. Yes, the offer came in late last night. It was too late to call you.
A. Is the offer as high as we were hoping for?
B. They offered two hundred eighty thousand dollars, and you were asking three 
hundred thousand dollars. They are definitely in the ballpark.
A. I was prepared to go a little lower, but more like two hundred ninety 
thousand dollars.
B. Would you like to make a counteroffer of two hundred ninety thousand dollars?
A. I definitely would like to make a counteroffer.
B. I will FAX them the counteroffer right away.
A. What if my counteroffer gets turned down?
B. They have an option of making a counteroffer, or they can just reject your 
counteroffer.

A. Your office called and said that an offer came in on our house.
B. Yes, the offer came in less than an hour ago.
A. How good of an offer did we receive?
B. Their bid was two hundred eighty thousand dollars, and you said that you 
wanted three hundred thousand dollars. Their bid is a reasonable start.
A. We built a little leeway into the asking price, but I don't want to accept 
less than two hundred ninety thousand dollars.
B. Sellers frequently make a counteroffer. Would you like to counteroffer two 
hundred ninety thousand dollars?
A. I think that a counteroffer would be wise at this point.
B. I will contact their agent right away with your counteroffer.
A. What should we do if they don't like the counteroffer?
B. If the seller doesn't want to accept your counteroffer, they can reject it or 
come up with a counteroffer of their own.

A. My assistant called and said that you had received a response to our 
counteroffer.
B. Yes, the buyers called me just an hour ago.
A. Did they accept the counteroffer?
B. They came back with their own counteroffer of five thousand less than you 
wanted.
A. What do you think about their offer?
B. I think that this is a good offer. They also would like to have a 90-day 
escrow to allow them to sell their home. 
A. The length of the escrow is not a huge issue with us.
B. They also want the sale contingent on a good building inspection.
A. That is reasonable, and I accept those conditions.
B. I will let them know that you have accepted their counteroffer. They will be 
very pleased!

A. I had a message on my phone that the buyers had responded to our 
counteroffer.
B. Yes, the response just came through on the fax machine.
A. Was the counteroffer acceptable to them?
B. They made their own counteroffer of five thousand less than you proposed.
A. Do you feel that their counteroffer is reasonable?
B. Their offer is a good one. They also want to have a short escrow as they have 
already sold their home and are ready to move in.
A. We can accommodate the buyer's desire for an escrow length of their choosing.
B. They want their building inspector to approve the quality of the house.
A. I would expect that to be the case and accept their counteroffer.
B. I will contact the buyers immediately and let them know of your acceptance of 
their counteroffer. I am sure they will be excited!

A. I was calling in to see if there had been any response from the buyers 
regarding my counteroffer.
B. Yes, the buyer's agent just contacted me while I was at an Open House.
A. Did they state whether the counteroffer worked for them or not?
B. They almost accepted your counteroffer price but want to go a little lower. 
They are offering five thousand less than your counteroffer.
A. In your professional opinion, is this a good offer?
B. Personally in today's market, I would accept the offer. They also want a 
short escrow as they feel that interest rates are low right now. 
A. We can either lengthen or shorten the escrow for the buyer.
B. They want to make sure that the inspector says that there are no major 
problems with the house before this is a solid deal.
A. Of course, the house will have to pass a basic inspection, but we accept 
their counteroffer.
B. The buyers will be happy to hear that you have accepted their counteroffer.

A. I was calling to see if the buyers had accepted my counteroffer.
B. Yes, actually they just called back with a counteroffer of their own.
A. Is the counteroffer close to the asking price?
B. The counteroffer is for ten thousand less than your asking price.
A. I didn't really want to go that low in my pricing.
B. I agree that that price is too low. Your home is in good shape, and you 
should get a better price for it.
A. What should I do at this point?
B. Since you don't want to go any lower, we can notify them that you are 
rejecting their latest offer.
A. Can you take care of that for me and get back to me?
B. I will let them know that your counteroffer was the lowest price that you 
will accept.

A. Has there been any word about whether the buyers have accepted my 
counteroffer?
B. Yes, I was going to call you this morning. Your buyers have responded with a 
counteroffer.
A. Is the counteroffer a good one?
B. They are now offering ten thousand less than your asking price.
A. That is really a bit lower in price than I would like to go.
B. I think that your feelings are valid. You have a beautiful home and can 
afford to wait for a better offer.
A. What is the next step?
B. You can flat-out reject their offer and see what they come up with.
A. I would like you to notify them that I am rejecting their offer.
B. I will notify the buyers that you will not accept their counteroffer.

A. I was wondering if the buyers have accepted my counteroffer.
B. Yes, I just faxed you the information an hour ago. The buyers have a 
counteroffer for you.
A. How much did they counteroffer?
B. They now are offering to pay ten thousand less than your asking price.
A. I am not really ready to accept that low of a price.
B. I wouldn't accept that price either. Your home is in a good area and should 
command a higher price.
A. Where do we go from here?
B. We should notify them that you are rejecting their current offer. They might 
choose to offer a higher price.
A. Please let the buyers know that I am rejecting their offer.
B. I will take care of that right away. They may or may not raise their offer.

A. Your office called and left a message that several offers had come in on our 
home.
B. Yes, we received three offers in one day for your home!
A. Were the offers for a good price?
B. One offer was for the full asking price, one slightly below, and one above.
A. Well, I am going to accept the highest bid, of course!
B. Actually there are a few things to consider other than who is offering the 
most money.
A. What other factors do I need to consider?
B. We need to consider the likelihood of the buyers actually being able to 
purchase the house.
A. How do we check on the buyer's ability to purchase our home?
B. We will check to see if these buyers are pre-qualified for the loan amount 
that they need. This information will help you make a good decision.
A. When we get all of that information, then I will make my decision.
B. When you make that decision, I will present it to the buyers.

A. I received your e-mail about the many purchase offers for my house.
B. It has been quite a busy day regarding your home. We just received three 
offers!
A. Did the potential buyers offer a good price?
B. There were offers above and below your asking price, as well as one exactly 
for the asking price.
A. The highest bid is always the best bid!
B. We need to look at the big picture in deciding which bid to accept.
A. What things would you like me to look at?
B. Just because a buyer offers the money doesn't mean that they actually have 
the credit to purchase the home.
A. How do I get the information about a buyer's ability to afford to buy a home?
B. We will check to see if any of these buyers have a large down payment. A 
large amount of available cash would be a good sign.
A. I will wait for that information and give you my answer.
B. Please let me know when you have made your decision, and I will contact the 
buyers.

A. My friend said that you had called regarding multiple offers for my home.
B. The Open House was quite a success. Last night we received three offers on 
your home!
A. I am anxious to hear how good an offer we received!
B. Offers above and below the asking price came in. One was right on the money.
A. Let's go with the highest bid!
B. We need to look at a number of factors in deciding which bid to go with.
A. What matters besides getting the money for the house?
B. We need to make sure that these potential buyers all actually qualify to even 
purchase a home.
A. I don't even know where to begin checking on a buyer's credit information.
B. We can check to see if these buyers have already sold their current home. 
This would make them more desirable. 
A. I think that gathering that information will be helpful to me.
B. Please let me know if I can further assist you in making your decision.

A. I heard that the potential buyer is interested in me carrying part of a loan 
for him.
B. Carrying part of a loan can be a good or a bad thing, depending on the 
circumstances.
A. What would be an advantage of me carrying a note on the house?
B. If you don't need the money right away, you can earn a fairly good interest 
rate.
A. Why does my buyer want me to carry part of his loan?
B. In this economy, buyers sometimes have trouble getting a loan even when they 
have good credit.
A. What are the risks to me?
B. The risk is that the market could drop drastically and the owner would walk 
away.
A. How long will I need to commit to financing this loan?
B. You need to make an agreement with the buyer as to how long you will carry 
this note.

A. My potential buyer has asked me to carry part of his loan.
B. The decision to carry part of a loan might be advantageous to you or 
problematic.
A. Why would I ever want to carry a note on a house?
B. It is a type of investment that can offer a fairly steady return over a set 
period of time.
A. Why is my buyer requesting that I carry part of his loan?
B. Oftentimes buyers are well able to afford the home but unable to qualify for 
a loan.
A. Are there any risks in carrying a second mortgage?
B. You are basically betting on the fact that the home is not going to 
drastically fall in price. This could leave you with a house that is not worth 
much.
A. Will I be financing this loan for a set period of time?
B. That is entirely up to you and the buyer.

A. If the purchaser of your home wants you to carry part of the loan, is that 
good?
B. Carrying a loan could be good or bad for you as a seller.
A. Why would it be a good thing to carry a note on my own house?
B. For investors who can afford to have their money tied up, it can offer a 
fairly nice return.
A. What advantage is my buyer looking for in having me carry him on paper?
B. We are seeing more and more buyers who are not able to qualify for a loan and 
are able to take out a second mortgage with the owner.
A. Can I lose my money if I carry a second mortgage?
B. It is an investment and carries some risks. You are counting on the housing 
market to not go into a tailspin.
A. Is there a certain amount of time that I will be carrying this loan?
B. The buyer and seller set the year for the loan to come due.

A. I really need help knowing what to do about transferring the deed of my 
house.
B. The work of legally transferring the deed of your house will be taken care of 
in escrow.
A. What is the first thing that they will do?
B. The first thing they do is a title search to make sure that there are no 
liens against your property.
A. What if I have a lien against my property?
B. Your home cannot be sold until you clear all liens.
A. How long will the escrow take?
B. You can control some aspects of the length of your escrow but not all. 
Complete all paperwork in a timely fashion.

outstanding liens against the property.
A. What if they discover a lien against my property?

B. Thirty to ninety days is about how long it takes to complete an escrow.

A. Do you have any helpful hints for preparing to move out of my home?
B. The first thing I would do is to make a list of what needs to be done. Then 
number the items as to what can be done ahead of time.
A. What kinds of things should be on my list?
B. First would probably be to get rid of any extra things that you have by 
having a garage sale.
A. That is a good idea because I have way too much junk.
B. You also should schedule your moving van in advance.
A. Can I begin packing things ahead of time?
B. Yes, just keep in mind what you won't be using in the near future and pack 
those items first.
A. Should I schedule my utilities to be shut off?
B. You need to work that out ahead of time with your utility companies and the 
new owners.

A. I was wondering if you had any useful suggestions for how to prepare for our 
moving day.
B. Make a prioritized list of what needs to be done and when. Many things can be 
done ahead of time.
A. Can you give me some suggestions for my list?
B. Many people have a garage sale to avoid moving things that they no longer 
use.
A. That would certainly cut down on the price of moving.
B. Make sure that you take the time to schedule your moving van.
A. Would it be okay to get a head start on my packing?
B. Begin by packing things that you don't frequently need. Save only a few 
things until right before your moving date.
A. When should I have my utilities shut off?
B. It is best for you and the new owners to coordinate the transfer of the 
utilities and what needs to be turned off and on.

A. I want our moving day to go smoothly and am open to your suggestions.
B. I would suggest that you make a list and check off the items as you go along. 
The list will get shorter as your moving date approaches.
A. What things do people usually put on their moving-out list?
B. One thing that can be done ahead of time is to get rid of excess stuff by 
having a garage sale.
A. That would mean a lot less time wasted in packing up our things.
B. List scheduling your moving van as an item on your to do list.
A. Do people ever start packing a month or so before moving?
B. You can certainly start packing things that you won't be using right away.
A. I don't know if I should have my utilities shut off or leave them on for the 
people who are moving in.
B. You could simply have all the utilities shut off on the day you move out, but 
you might want to coordinate that with the new owners.

A. Is the moving van here yet?
B. Yes, it just pulled up to the curb. Here we go! 
A. Could you double-check and make sure that everything made it into the boxes?
B. I have already done that. Would you like me to put our suitcases into the 
car?
A. Yes, this would be a good time to do that.
B. I am so glad that we took the time to pack our essentials into suitcases. It 
will tide us over until the van arrives at our new home.
A. Would this be a good time to pack the frozen food into the ice chest?
B. I think that we should wait until the very last minute to do that.
A. I am going to take the dog for a walk so that he doesn't get too stressed out 
as the movers are working.
B. Well, let's get started sweeping up and do a last minute cleaning.

A. Do you think that the moving van has arrived?
B. It's coming down the street even as we speak.
A. Could I ask you to make one last check to make sure that everything got into 
the boxes?
B. Relax. Do you need me to put the suitcases in the car?
A. Yes, let's do that right now. 
B. It was such a good idea to pack a suitcase to have some things with us while 
we are waiting for the moving van to arrive on the other end.
A. Maybe we could pack the frozen food into the ice chest?
B. Let's wait until the van is almost completely loaded to take care of that.
A. I am sure happy that we dropped the cats off at the kennel so they aren't 
freaking out.
B. I am going to start sweeping up the floor. I want the new owners to not have 
to clean up a mess.

A. Could you check and see if the moving van is out there yet?
B. It just arrived. They are parking at the curb right now.
A. Do me a favor and do one last walk-through to check for anything that may not 
have gotten packed.
B. We've already double-checked everything. Should we put the suitcases in the 
car?
A. It is the perfect time to take care of that.
B. I am so happy that we didn't pack all of our clothes into boxes. The suitcase 
of clothes will help us get to what we need until our boxes arrive.
A. Should we empty the freezer into the ice chest?
B. Let's do a few more things and then take care of that as one of the last 
things we do.
A. Deciding to keep the birds at the neighbors until we leave was a good idea.
B. Let's sweep the floor on our way out so we don't leave too big of a mess 
behind.
